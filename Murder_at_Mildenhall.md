### Chapter One ###

He knew something was wrong the minute he walked in. A definite atmosphere prevailed --- so that he hesitated before calling out his usual greeting, even though his wife and daughter must have heard his key in the lock, and the padding of the dog's feet on the hall floor. 'Hello? Anybody home? The answer to his question came in the form of rapid footsteps on the stairs, heralding the appearance --- and subsequent disappearance --- of his daughter, who, muttering something he didn't catch, rushed past him out of the open front door.
This was bad. Rowlands let Rex off the lead; then hung up his coat and exchanged his shoes for slippers. He was halfway up the stairs when Edith came out of one of the bedrooms onto the landing. 'Oh! You're back,' she said, sounding rather put out at the fact, although Rowlands's return at this hour --- half past six --- was so much a matter of habit as not to require comment. His wife was obviously upset, and doing her best to hide it. 'Go to your basket, Rex!' she commanded, as the dog made as if to follow Rowlands upstairs. 	
'Edith...'
'Yes?' Her tone was over-bright. 'Go on, you silly dog. We're coming down.'
'What's up?' For a moment Rowlands thought that she was going to persist in her pretence that nothing was 'up'. Then she said: 'It's Anne.' This much he had gathered. 'She... I... I really can't put up with being called a liar, in my own house.' Edith seldom cried, but she sounded close to tears now. 'Come on,' said Rowlands gently. 'You'd better tell me all about it.' 
'I've got to start making supper,' said Edith, but she didn't protest when he followed her down to the basement kitchen, and sat down at the table, while she busied herself filling a saucepan for the potatoes. 'I never meant to read the letter,' she said at last, her voice slightly muffled by the fact that she was standing at the sink, with her back to her husband. 'It was just lying there, on the dressing-table. In plain view,' she added defiantly. 'There wasn't time to read more than a few words before she... before Anne... burst in, and started making accusations.'
'I see,' he said, wondering what she'd been doing in Anne's room in the first place. 'I was taking her some ironing,' said Edith, as if she'd heard this unvoiced question. 'She's so particular about having a fresh blouse every day. and she's going back tomorrow, so I thought...' She broke off, as if recalling that this was the last day of Anne's forty-eight hour leave. 'I'm sure it'll all blow over,' he said.
It wasn't the first time that his wife and middle daughter had fallen out. Their relationship had always been a difficult one --- Edith's tendency to be over-critical of her dreamy, artistic daughter coming up against a certain stubbornness on the part of the latter, which had become more pronounced in recent years. 'Mummy just won't accept that I have a mind of my own,' she'd said to her father, after some previous dispute. Now that her visits home were less frequent --- she was currently stationed with the WAAFs at an airbase somewhere in East Anglia --- things had improved somewhat. A pity that she and her mother couldn't have managed to keep the peace for one more day,  Rowlands thought. 
'Can't I peel the potatoes for you?' he said, hoping to divert Edith from her bleak mood. But she wasn't to be diverted. 'You don't understand. The letter was from a foreigner. Some Polish man, with one of those names that are all 'c's' and 'z's'...' It struck Rowlands that, in order to have discovered this, she must have read to the end of the letter --- but he refrained from pointing this out. 'It's probably somebody she's met at the base,' he said. 'They get all nationalities there, I imagine.'
'Yes, but why is he writing to her?' said Edith angrily. 'Some man we've never even heard of.' Well, we have now, Rowlands thought. 'I shouldn't worry too much,' he said. 'I'm sure Anne's too sensible to get involved in anything she can't handle. I'll talk to her, if you like,' he added. Although it really wasn't his business --- or her mother's --- whom she chose to write to. She was twenty-one, wasn't she? Quite capable of making up her own mind about this or anything else. But he knew he'd get no peace until he agreed to mediate. Fortunately, he and Anne got on much better than Anne and her mother.
Both of them heard the front door open, and Anne's quick footsteps in the hall. She wasn't someone who harboured grudges, and Rowlands guessed that a brisk walk along the sea-front had helped to dissipate her anger. They heard the door to the sitting-room creak open; a moment later, the strains of Benny Goodman's String of Pearls issued from the wireless. 'Go on,' said Edith to her husband. 'You talk to her, while I get on with this.'
Rowlands accordingly went upstairs. 'Mind if I join you? he said, as he entered the room. 'Your mother's refused my offer of help with making dinner and so I thought...'
'His name's Jan Wawrzkowicz,' said Anne. 'He's just a friend.' This was said with a certain truculence, as if she expected to be contradicted. Rowlands held up his hands in a gesture of surrender. 'Look, it's none of my business,' he said. 'Your mother's concerned about you, that's all.'
'She never was when I was going out with Robin.'
'We'd met Robin's parents,' her father said mildly --- not adding that he, for one, had been glad when Anne had stopped seeing the young man, a fellow art student from Anne's time at the Slade, whom he'd thought insufferably conceited. 'Yes, well, meeting Jan's parents might present a problem,' said Anne wryly. 'Seeing that they're in Lvov. Anyway, as I said, it's nothing serious. We've been out a few times. Jan's got a motorbike,' she added mischievously. 'Well, for goodness sake be careful,' he said, rising to the bait, as she had known he would. 'Just because we're at war, doesn't mean you should be risking your neck, rushing about on motorcycles with this Mr... Vatch-kovich... or whatever his name is.'
'No, Daddy,' she said indulgently. 'I promise we won't rush about.'
The sitting-room at Dorset Gardens had a pleasant cosiness, although it was of course good deal smaller than the one in the Kingston house, from which the family had moved after bomb damage had made it uninhabitable. The fire, which Rowlands had lit some time before, was now throwing out a pleasant heat, counteracting the February chill. With the two elder girls away doing their respective forms of war work, and Rowlands's youngest daughter, Joan, boarding with her uncle and aunt in Surrey during the week, the little house in Brighton's Old Town was perfectly adequate for the needs of its three full-time residents --- himself, Edith, and Edith's mother, Helen.
It was only when the third bedroom was occupied --- as it was now --- that the place seemed cramped. Maybe this accounted for the present falling-out between Anne and her mother, thought Rowlands. In Grove Crescent, each of the girls had had her own room. 'I'm sure your mother didn't mean to pry,' he said. 'She just forgot that you're grown-up now, and need your privacy.'
'Huh,' said Anne, but she didn't argue with this. 'I suppose I'd better get packed, if I'm to catch that early train tomorrow morning.' She got up, and dropped a kiss on her father's forehead. 'All right,' she said. 'I'll go and make it up with her.'

The next few days were busy ones for Frederick Rowlands. After the increasing likelihood of enemy invasion had made it imperative for St Dunstan's --- by then established as a hospital and rehabilitation centre for newly blinded servicemen --- to move from its purpose-built, cliff-top site at Ovingdean, to Church Stretton in Shropshire, Rowlands had assumed his own days as administrator for the South Coast branch of the organisation would be numbered. The commandeering of the building as a naval training centre by the Admiralty, and the subsequent take-over of West House, where Rowlands's office was located, had confirmed him in this supposition. 
As it turned out, his workload these days was heavier than ever. With a network of home-workers across the country now employed, not in the peacetime crafts of basket-making and carpentry, but in manufacturing camouflage nets and mats for anti-aircraft guns, Rowlands had his work cut out, making sure supplies of raw materials were kept up. Nor was this his only responsibility. Many of the more able-bodied St Dunstaners were already working in factories and offices; others, more recently blinded, were being trained for such work --- releasing sighted men for war service. In the twenty-five years since St Dunstan's had been founded, its training schools had prepared hundreds of men for life in the outside world. 
When Rowlands had entered St Dunstan's as a young man, in 1917, men were mainly taught practical skills: wood-working, boot repairing, and animal husbandry. Now there were St Dunstan's men in industry, accountancy, and the law. Brighton's justice of the peace, Mr Curtis-Willson, another blind veteran of the Great War, was one such.
Rowlands himself had trained as a telephonist, on a specially adapted switchboard, and had worked for seven years as the receptionist for Saville and Willoughby, a firm of City solicitors, before events beyond his control had brought about his resignation. It was a time he looked back on with mingled fondness and regret. It had been in many ways an uncomplicated existence, travelling up to the London Bridge office in the morning, and returning home at the same time every day, with only the usual domestic worries to trouble him. That had been before he'd been caught up in a murder case, whose outcome had changed his life forever... Now he was working in an office once more, trying to get to grips with all the mundane but essential tasks involved in running an organisation catering to the needs of several hundred men and their families.
Assisting him in this endeavour was the estimable Miss Bates, who typed letters, fielded telephone calls, and carried out the myriad small errands which a job like this entailed. Just lately, she had benefitted from the unofficial assistance of John Harvey --- formerly Corporal Harvey of the East Lancashire Regiment. When Rowlands had first met him, two years before, at the Ovingdean centre, he had been recuperating from the injury which had blinded him --- a particularly stupid one, he said, because it had been incurred during a training exercise, when a blank cartridge had been accidentally discharged into his face. 'So I didn't even get to see active service,' he'd said bitterly. 'It's that that really gives me the pip --- the fact that it was all for nothing.' 
Encouraged by Rowlands, Harvey had also done telephony and shorthand training. Now he was trying to find a job in some branch of industry or business where such skills would be required. So far he had been unsuccessful --- much to his disgust. 'I thought I really had a chance with this one,' he was saying to Mavis Bates, as Rowlands returned to the office after his lunchtime stroll. 'But it's been two days and they haven't got back to me...' Patience was not one of young Harvey's virtues, thought Rowlands. 'Good boy, Rex,' he said, as the Labrador settled down in his usual spot beneath the desk. The dog thumped his tail, as if in reply. 'Any messages?' Rowlands asked his secretary. 'Sir Ian rang.'  This was the head of St Dunstan's and an old friend of Rowlands's. 'Says would you ring him when you have a minute.' 
'Ah, that'll be about the pensions issue, I expect.' Ian Fraser was an indefatigable campaigner for the rights of St Dunstan's men (women, too, these days, he was quick to add). Outraged to find that the basic pension for those blinded in the present conflict was to be only 32 shillings and sixpence per week, a cut in real terms from the 40 shillings a week received by those who had served in the Great War, he had set out to do something about this --- which as a recently re-elected MP, he was in a position to do. Doubtless he would be wanting to enlist Rowlands's support for his campaign against what he described as blatant discrimination against the newly disabled. 'Anything else? No? Then you'd better get off for your lunch, Miss Bates. I'll hold the fort.'
Both young people made ready to go out. 'John's been helping me pack up the files,' said Mavis Bates. Now that the Admiralty had commandeered West House for its own use, the St Dunstan's After-Care Unit had been forced to transfer its operations to a smaller premises in the same building --- actually a terrace of Regency houses converted to this purpose. 'He's going to help me carry them through to the new office, aren't you, John?' Harvey agreed that he would. 'At least I'm fit for that, if for nothing else,' he said. She wasn't having this. 'Don't be such a Gloomy Gus! Tell you what --- if you can get all these boxes out of here before the end of the day, I'll let you take me to tea.'
Their laughter floated back up the stairs, to where Rowlands sat in the half-dismantled office. He smiled to himself, and patted Rex's head. It was good to see how much John Harvey had changed, from the angry young man Rowlands had encountered two years before at the rehabilitation centre, to the more optimistic fellow he was now. A lot of that was to do with Mavis Bates, of course. She was such a cheerful girl. Hard to imagine any man staying miserable for long, with her around.
The telephone rang. That would be the Major, he thought. Even though more than twenty-five years had passed since Rowlands, recovering from the shrapnel wounds which had left him blind, had first met Ian Fraser, then newly appointed head of St Dunstan's, he still thought of him by his wartime rank. He lifted the receiver. 'Hello?' he said, expecting to hear the familiar, warm tones of his old friend's voice. Instead, there was a faint crackling, as of a faulty connection; then a voice, which was no less familiar, said: 'Daddy? Is that you?'
He felt a twinge of alarm. 'Yes, it's me, Anne. Anything the matter?' The arrangement was that she telephoned her parents at home once a week, on a Sunday. For her to ring him at the office on a Monday morning meant it must be something serious. 'Oh, Daddy, you've got to come. You're the only one who can help...' 
'Of course I'll help. But what's happened?' Terrible possibilities went through his head. 'Are you all right? You're not hurt...?' 
'I'm fine. It's not me. It's Jan.' Her voice faltered; broke into a sob. 'He's... he's been arrested. For murder.'
Rowlands caught his breath. 'I see,' he said. His voice was calm, but inwardly he was in turmoil. Why on earth had she --- his beloved Anne --- got herself involved with a man like this Jan Wawrzkowicz? A man who, from the sound of it, was a thoroughly bad lot. It just wasn't fair. 'You'd better tell me all about it,' he said. 'I... The fact is, I can't talk for long,' said Anne, sounding increasingly agitated. 'I'm calling from a telephone box. My money's going to run out at any minute... Oh, Daddy...' Suddenly she sounded much younger than her twenty-one years. 'You will help, won't you? I didn't know who else to turn to.'
'All right.' He was thinking fast. 'I don't suppose you've got any more leave?'
'Not for another month.'
'Then I'll have to come to you. Where are you, exactly?'
She hesitated. 'We're not supposed to say. I'm breaking all the rules by telephoning you like this. But it's all I could think of to do...'
'Let me take a guess,' said Rowlands. 'Surely that's not against the rules? You're in a Suffolk town, the name of which begins with "M"...'
'Yes. Oh, Daddy, you will come, won't you?'
'Just name a place to meet. I assume there's a local pub?'
'The King's Head. I can get off by seven... That's the pips going now...'
'I'll see you at seven,' said Rowlands. As he replaced the receiver in its cradle, he consulted his watch, his fingers skating lightly around the circle of raised dots until they found the hour hand. It was just on one o'clock. If he set off now, he could be at Liverpool Street by half-past three, in time to catch the quarter-to train to Cambridge, and have arrived in that university city by five-thirty, in order to connect with the branch line that would take him to his destination. Mildenhall.
It was rough on Mavis Bates to leave her on her own, but she'd cope, he thought --- and she wouldn't be on her own, with young Harvey to help out, he reminded himself. Quickly, he typed a note on his Remington machine, to say he'd been called away on an urgent matter, and would be back in the office next day. Having signed it, he left it in a prominent place on Miss Bates's desk; then grabbed his coat and scarf from the rack. 'Come on, Rex, old boy,' he said, re-attaching the dog's lead. 'We're off again.' Rex made no objection to the prospect of another walk, and the two of them set off, as soon as Rowlands had locked the door of the office behind him.
In the two years since Rowlands had acquired his guide-dog, he'd grown used to relying on Rex's well-honed instinct for everyday dangers: for the sounds of approaching traffic, the unexpected obstacle, or the sudden change of level that could precipitate a fall. So that now, reaching the intersection with the main road that ran along the sea-front, Rowlands was content to let the animal take charge --- something he'd found it hard to adjust to initially. When he'd first acquired Rex, the dog had been fitted with a cumbersome harness whose handle his master had had to get used to holding --- an imposition worse than having to rely on a dog at all, he'd thought. So the harness and handle had been discarded, and a conventional lead substituted --- since, Rowlands argued, both he and Rex could manage perfectly well with this arrangement, and it didn't make him feel so conspicuous. 
 Now he took it for granted that Rex would pause at the kerb, wait for a few seconds, to ascertain whether the way was clear, and then, once he was satisfied that it was, lead his master across the wide thoroughfare to safety. Rex would then walk by Rowlands' side, checking their progress only when an obstacle --- whether lamppost or approaching pedestrian --- loomed up in his sights. He had been trained to skirt the lampposts, as much as the human beings, although the same could not be said for the latter, who often reached down to pat him, and address a word to his master. In the past two years, Rowlands found that being accompanied by a dog had given him instant popularity.
Obstacles of a more sinister kind were to be found along this stretch of the sea-front --- concrete blocks, anti-tank defences, coils of barbed wire and the massive emplacements of Bofors guns; these, too, Rex took in his stride. Nor was he distracted by the large number of military vehicles --- trucks, cars and motorbikes --- which roared up and down all day. It struck Rowlands that, having spent the past two years in what was effectively a military camp, Rex might find the quiet of the countryside more of challenge than the busy streets of Brighton.
It was a fifteen minute walk from the office to Dorset Gardens; another fifteen minutes from there to the station. He'd have time to collect an overnight bag before setting out on his journey. Edith, he knew, would not be at home: since she'd learned to drive, she'd been on the WVS rota for delivering hot meals to the elderly and housebound; today was one of her days in the van. But Helen, Rowlands's mother-in-law, was in. 'You're back early,' she called, as he let himself in. 'Nothing amiss at work, I hope?'
'No. Everything's fine at work.' He hesitated, wondering how much to tell her. After all, it might amount to nothing. 'I had a telephone call from Anne. She... she sounded rather upset...'
'Boy trouble, do you suppose?' Helen Edwards was nothing if not shrewd. 'Something like that,' he admitted. 'I'll know more when I've talked to her.' 
'Must be pretty serious, if you're dashing up to... wherever it is,' she observed. 'Have you time for a cup of tea?'
'Well...' It would be several hours before he had the chance again, Rowlands knew --- and the tea in those station buffets was invariably stewed. 'Maybe just a quick cup,' he said. 'I'll give Rex some water, too,' said Mrs Edwards. 'It can get awfully hot on those trains.' When he returned from packing his bag, the tea was poured. 'Drink up,' she said. 'You look as if you need it. And try not to worry,' she added. 'If I've learned anything, in a long life, it's that things seldom turn out to be as bad as one fears.' 
Rowlands was grateful to his mother-in-law for not bombarding him with questions about his unscheduled trip to East Anglia, the way Edith would have done --- especially since the latter would certainly have got it out of him that Jan Wawrzkowicz was the cause of it. As it was, he hoped he'd be able to get to the bottom of the affair without his wife having to know more than the bare facts, whatever those were. Although it struck him, as he and Rex began the steep climb that would bring them to Brighton Station, that once again he seemed to have found himself mixed up in murder.


### Chapter Two ###

The train was full, as they always were these days, with servicemen and women going on leave, or returning to base. Even at this time of day --- early afternoon --- there was not a seat to be had. Discovering this, Rowlands had taken up a stand in the corridor, and was just lighting a cigarette, when one of the occupants of the compartment next to him slid back the glass door and leaned out. 'I say, mister, why don't you have my seat? Plenty room on the floor for Fido, too.'
'That's awfully nice of you,' said Rowlands. 'But I don't mind standing.' Then it occurred to him that such a courteous offer from a member of the younger generation ought not to be rejected. 'On second thoughts,' he added. 'I'd be glad of a seat.'
'That's the stuff!' said the other, making way for him. 'Wouldn't be right for you to have to stand all the way to London.' As he passed, he bent down to scratch the dog's head. 'Good boy,' he said. 'Got a black Lab at home just like this one. Nice, steady dogs.'
'They are,' said Rowlands, taking the offered seat as, with a hiss of steam and a shrieking of the guard's whistle, the train began to move. He held out the pack of Churchman's. 'Care for one of these?'
'Don't mind if I do.'
'Anybody else?' said Rowlands, guessing correctly that the other occupants of the carriage were part of the same group of naval ratings --- a jolly bunch, to judge from their conversation --- on their way to the 'Smoke' for a couple of days' leave. Cigarettes were accordingly accepted and lit, and the first part of the journey passed agreeably enough, with talk of what the lads were planning to do that night ---  two of them wanted to go 'up West' to see a show, while the rest were for finding a nice pub, and settling down for a game of darts and a pint or two. Rowlands's young friend, who kept popping his head in from the corridor, in order to join in this discussion, wouldn't be drawn on how he intended to spend his leave. 'Oh, Bill's got other fish to fry, haven't you, old man?' quipped one of his mates. 'A very pretty fish, ain't she, Billy?'
'You leave my Betty out of it ,' said the lad. 'And she wouldn't take kindly to being called a "fish", neither.'
'No offence,' was the reply. 'Taking her for champagne at the Ritz, are you?'
'Thanks, but tea and cakes at the ABC, and a night at the pictures, will do nicely for us,' said Bill.
Listening to this lively banter, Rowlands couldn't help wishing that his Anne might have been looking forward to just such an evening of harmless fun, with some nice, ordinary chap instead of... well, whatever it was she'd got herself mixed up in. Her sister, Margaret, had been fortunate in this respect, he thought. Frank Dawson --- Lieutenant Dawson, he was now --- seemed a thoroughly good sort; although it was true that Rowlands' acquaintance with his eldest daughter's fiancé had been limited to the few days the young naval officer had spent with the family last Christmas. If only Anne... but he let the thought go. There was nothing to be done, until he could see the whole picture.
The train to Cambridge was as full as the London one had been, but with a preponderance of RAF servicemen, to judge from the talk of 'prangs', 'kites', 'corkscrews' and 'milk runs' to be heard from some of Rowlands' fellow passengers. From their voices --- and boisterous high spirits --- he guessed that most of them were only just out of their teens. At Cambridge station, there was a twenty-minute wait for the connection to Mildenhall, and so Rowlands and his canine companion found a seat in the station buffet, where a cup of tea and a bun for the former, and a bowl of water for the latter, offered welcome refreshment. Their train was announced at last, and Rowlands, with the faithful Rex leading the way, hastened down the famously long platform to its furthest end. 'Nice dog,' said a voice, belonging to one of the young men with whom he'd fallen into company. 'What's his name?'
Rowlands told him. 'He looks like a Rex,' was the reply. 'Very regal and dignified --- aren't you, old boy?' They reached the platform, where the engine stood, noisily exuding blasts of steam. The youth, who introduced himself as 'Flying Officer Robert Travers --- but my friends call me Bob,' helped Rowlands to find a seat, heaving his kitbag, Rowlands' suitcase, and their respective gas-masks, onto the luggage rack --- all the while talking of dogs. 'Best dog I ever owned was a Labrador,' he was saying, throwing himself into the seat opposite Rowlands', as around them the carriage filled up. 'Name of Barkiss, as in...'
'Barkiss is willing,' supplied Rowlands, amused to find a fellow Dickens lover among this crowd of noisy young people. 'Got it in one,' said Travers. 'Rather a neat chat-up line, I always think, on the part of old Barkiss... Now then,' --- addressing his peers --- 'who's for a game of gin rummy?' There was certainly need for some kind of diversion to fill the next forty-five minutes. The branch-line, along which they were now proceeding at a rather leisurely pace, stopped at every station along the twenty-mile route: Barnwell Junction, Fen Ditton (this was a mere Halt, and so nobody got on or off), Quy, Bottisham and Lode, Swaffham Prior, Exning Road, Fordham... 
The names were redolent of a different country --- the Fens --- with its own people, and history. A world away, thought Rowlands, from the metropolitan bustle of his birthplace, London, or the raffish glamour of Brighton; this was a part of England which had remained unchanged for centuries, and which had faced down invaders of one sort or another since before the Romans came. His ancestors were from East Anglia: he was familiar with its inward-looking, and fiercely guarded, traditions. As an outsider, you stood no chance of penetrating these until you had been accepted --- a process which could take years, if it happened at all.
Not that there hadn't been changes since his boyhood, he reminded himself. The last war had brought these about --- and the advent of the motorcar. He remembered Great Uncle Horatio's horror the day one of these 'infernal machines', as he'd called them, had come racing along the lane that ran between the family farm and the big meadow, where, at the end of a working day, the great shire horses were let out for their exercise. The old man had stood fuming and shaking his fist at the intruder, which had kicked up a cloud of white dust as it roared past, leaving a stink of exhaust fumes in its wake. Rowlands himself, then only a lad of ten, had thought it all rather exciting. But for his great-uncle, it had signalled the end of an era --- a more peaceful time, when horse-power had not yet given way to the combustion engine, and whole villages came together at harvest time, to get the crops in.
These days, of course, armoured vehicles thundered through the narrow lanes, and the roar of warplanes overhead drowned out the quieter sounds of rural life. He was glad the old man hadn't lived long enough to see his beloved countryside given over to concrete airstrips and Nissan huts --- nor that the war, which had taken one of Horatio Rowlands' sons, and his favourite nephew, was being fought all over again, against the same adversary... A shout of triumph recalled Rowlands to the here-and-now: 'That makes a hundred points for me!' sang out Bob Travers. 'I must have a lucky streak.'
'You know what they say about being lucky at cards,' said a voice Rowlands couldn't identify. Travers laughed. 'I'll take my chances, Briggsie, old son, if it's all the same to you. Now, about that half-crown you owe me...' This prompted some good-humoured grumbling, as those with whom the young flying officer had been playing cards paid up, with more or less good grace. 'Workington Golf Links!' shouted another of the group, to general groans --- it was the penultimate stop. This was the signal for those getting off at the terminus to retrieve kitbags, gas-masks and other luggage from the overhead racks, and a general shifting about ensued, as people who'd been lucky enough to find seats in the first instance got up, jostling those who'd been standing in the aisles.
'I say, watch out, can't you?' cried a female voice. 'You're trampling all over my feet...'
'Sorry!' was the cheerful reply. It was the lad who'd make the remark about being lucky in cards who spoke. 'But since I can't see your feet, or anything else in this blasted black-out, I wasn't aware they were in my way...'
'Well, if your feet weren't so big, you wouldn't need to hog other people's space. You glamour boys are all the same --- thinking yourself special...'
'Pardon me for breathing, Lady Muck! What say I buy you a drink at the Crown tonight, to make up for your sore footsie?'
'Clot.'
'Oh now, that's a bit harsh! I said I was sorry...'
'So you did. Maybe I'll think about that drink...'
 	A bit more of this kind of badinage ensued, before the train reached its destination at last. 'MildenHALL!' shouted the porter, as doors opened and the passengers who'd been crammed into the four carriages scrambled out. Given the crush, Rowlands decided it would be safest to keep his seat until everyone else had got off; then a touch on his shoulder alerted him to the fact that he wasn't the last. 'Need a hand down, sir?' said a voice he recognised as belonging to his fellow Dickens enthusiast. 'There's a bit of a step to the platform.'
'Thanks, I'd appreciate that.'
When both had disembarked, Rowlands gave Rex a gentle pat, signalling that he was ready to walk on. 'I don't suppose,' he said to Travers, when both had given up their tickets to the station master, 'that you could direct me to a pub called the King's Head?' It was just on half-past six, by his Braille watch. The journey had taken longer than expected, and he hoped that the pub wouldn't turn out to be miles from the station. 'Heading in that direction myself,' said the young man. 'My pass is until eight, so I've time for a quick one before I'm expected back at camp.'
'Sounds like a good idea,' said Rowlands, thinking that he too was in need of a drink, before facing whatever it was his daughter had to tell him.
The King's Head turned out to be a quiet pub of the traditional kind --- nothing like the flashy road-houses that had sprung up on the outskirts of Brighton in recent years. 'It's the old flint style of building you get around these parts,' said Bob Travers, as they went in. 'I'm familiar with the kind,' said Rowlands. 'My people were from Norfolk, originally. Farmers,' he added. 'What's your line of work, Mr Travers?'
The young man gave a short laugh. 'Apart from flying Lancasters, you mean? I did a year at Cambridge. Archeology. But I chucked all that eighteen months ago, when I joined up.'
When Rowlands had ordered them both pints of Adnams --- having refused Travers's offer to pay for his --- the two men sat down at a table in an inglenook. 'So tell me,' said the airman, after both had taken an appreciative sip. 'What brings you to this neck of the woods, if it's not an impertinent question? It's a long way from the South Coast.' Because in the conversational interludes between games of gin rummy, the two had exchanged this much information: Rowlands that he had travelled that day from Brighton; young Travers that he'd been visiting his mother in London that weekend. 
Rowlands hesitated. The pub was quiet --- it was not yet time for the 'evening shift', as Travers called it, when men not listed for that night's operations would be coming in to quench their thirsts --- and so, apart from a couple of elderly locals playing shove-halfpenny at an adjacent table, they were the only customers. 'It's a family matter,' he said at last. 'I'd rather not discuss it, if it's all the same to you.'
'Of course,' said the other hastily. 'Sorry if I've put my foot in it. I say, those pies look awfully good. Think I'll have one. The grub in the mess hall isn't up to much. Care to join me?'
Rowlands said that he'd wait thanks, but to go ahead. Travers ordered his pie. While he stood chatting with the landlord ('Any chance of a pickled egg to go with that?') the door opened, letting in a blast of cold air and --- to Rowland's relief --- his daughter. 'You made it, Daddy! I'm so glad... Oh!' She must have noticed that he wasn't alone. 'Hello, Bob.' Her tone was distinctly cooler than the one she'd used with her father. 'H-hello. S-sorry. Didn't realise...' The young man's embarrassment was compounded by the fact that he'd just take a bite of his pie. 'Mr Travers was just telling me about his studies at Cambridge,' said Rowlands, attempting to smooth over the awkwardness of the encounter. 'Oh?' said Anne, not sounding in the least interested. 'I'm afraid I haven't got time for chit-chat. I'll have to be back before roll-call, or I'll get a rocket...'
This, Rowlands gathered, was as much for Bob Travers's benefit as it was for his own. Certainly, it had the intended effect. 'Sorry,' mumbled the young man, having disposed of his mouthful of pie. 'I can see I'm not wanted. I'll just... It was good to meet you, sir,' he added to Rowlands, who smiled. 'Thanks for showing me the way here.'
'Oh... That's all right. Pub's a bit of a home-from-home, as you might have gathered. Anyway. Must be pushing along. See you around, Anne.' Then he was gone, letting the door fall shut behind him. 'You were a little abrupt, I thought,' said Rowlands to his daughter. 'He seemed like a decent enough young chap.' And, if he wasn't mistaken, more than a little smitten with Anne Rowlands. She gave an impatient snort. 'He's all right, I suppose. Bit of an ass. But I don't want to talk about Bob Travers.' She lowered her voice. 'Daddy, you've got to help Jan. He didn't do it. I know he didn't.'
'You'd better tell me all about it. Let me get you a drink first. What'll you have?'
'Oh. A half of whatever you're having. I told you, I haven't much time...'
'Then you'd better get on with it.' He left her making a fuss of the dog ('Good boy! Is he enjoying that nice bone, is he?') to go up to the bar. When he'd returned with the drinks, he said, 'All right, just give me the facts.' And so, hesitantly at first, Anne recounted what had taken place on the previous day. She'd planned to meet Jan after church parade, she said, sounding faintly embarrassed. 'For a walk,' she added, as if this needed explaining to her father. 'There are some pretty spots around here, once you get away from the airfield. Jan's got a motorbike --- I told you that, didn't I? --- so we sometimes go as far as Thetford Forest. It's quiet. Jan says it reminds him of the countryside around Lvov...' 
Only this time, she said, taking a sip of her beer, Jan hadn't shown up for their meeting. It was the first time he'd ever let her down. She thought that something must have happened --- perhaps his motorbike had got a puncture --- but she wasn't really worried. Not then. 'Where was he coming from?' interrupted Rowlands. 'I take it he isn't based at the airfield?'
'No. He's based... elsewhere,' said Anne. 'I can't really say where, because it's rather hush-hush.'
'I get the picture,' said her father, who had had enough experience dealing with the secret world to know that he shouldn't pursue this. 'Go on with what you were saying.'
'I'd waited at the teashop until just before midday, by which time I knew he wasn't coming. It was after I got back to camp around fifteen minutes later, that I heard what had happened. Jonny Bly had been shot. It was after the dance on Saturday night, they said. Jan and I were at the dance, but he'd left in good time to get back... to where he's based. There's a curfew, and...'
'What time was this?' said Rowlands. 'That he left you, I mean.'
'About half-past eleven. We always joke that it's a "Cinderella" curfew, and that if he doesn't get back by midnight, he'll turn into a pumpkin, or something...' Which told Rowlands that wherever Jan Wawrzkowicz was based, it was no more than half an hour's motorbike ride away. 'When did the shooting take place?' he asked. Anne hesitated. 'It was sometime after the dance finished, which was at midnight. I'd gone back to my hut by then, so I didn't hear anything about it --- or not until I returned from meeting Jan next day... or not meeting him, rather. By then, it was all round the camp --- that he'd been arrested for Jonny Bly's murder.' 
She was silent a moment. Rowlands, mindful that time was ticking away, thought it best to prompt her: 'So he --- your friend --- hadn't left Mildenhall when you thought he had?'
'Apparently not. They're saying he must have hung around after the dance was over and... and had words with Jonny.'
'What about?'
'I... I don't know exactly, but...' She broke off, then said, with a bravado he found heartbreaking, 'I think it might have been about me. Some people in the camp --- Jonny was one of them --- don't like Jan because he's a foreigner, and think that... that he shouldn't be friends with an English girl.' There! She'd said it. Rowlands could only admire her pluck. But he felt he had to know more, if he was going to be of use to her, and to her Polish sweetheart. 'Was Jonny also an admirer of yours?' he said gently. At once, Anne flared up: 'I didn't encourage him, if that's what you mean!'
'I never suggested you did. But it would help me to get a clearer picture if I knew the circumstances.'
'Sorry. Of course.' She sighed. 'Yes, I think he was sweet on me, for a while. All the Brylcreem Boys --- the fliers, I mean --- tend to get a bit sentimental around the WAAFs in the camp. It comes of having to face death so often, I suppose. There are lots of brief romances --- usually lasting only until the next mission's over. But there was never anything like that between Jonny and me. We'd had a few dances, at a previous hop, but it never turned into anything serious.'
'All right,' said Rowlands. 'So you're saying this Jonny Bly and your friend Jan had a fight?'
'That's what I heard.'
'Who did you hear it from?' It might have seemed an irrelevant question, but it was important to establish how soon the news had leaked out --- and who had leaked it. 'I don't remember... I mean, it was all round the camp.'
'Think. Who told you, in the first instance --- and what was said?'
Anne was silent a moment, as she considered this. 'I think it was Joyce Taylor... a girl in my hut. I'd just got back, and was changing my shoes before going across to the mess-hall for lunch, when she burst in. She said, "Where've you been?" She can be very nosey, Joyce. I said I'd been for a walk. And then she said, "You missed all the excitement. Jonny Bly's been shot. They're saying it's that Polish feller who's done it." And then Sandra Philips said...'
'She was there, too, was she?'
'Yes. She and Dilys Saunders. They always go around together. Sandra said, "I always did have my suspicions about that one. You were quite friendly with him, weren't you?" She knew perfectly well I was, but she wanted to make a point of it.'
 'What did you do then --- after you'd heard what had happened?' said Rowlands. 'Well, of course I rushed off to see my Section Leader --- that's Miss Henderson --- but I couldn't find her, so I thought I'd better go straight to Group Captain Forrester, because he'd probably know more about the situation than she would... Only he refused to tell me any more than the bare facts --- that Jan had been arrested --- and they wouldn't let me see him, even though I begged and begged. I was just told he was in custody, and that the MPs would be investigating... That's when I rang you.'
'I'm glad you did. But I'm not sure how much I can do. If your friend's innocent...'
'Of course he's innocent!'
'... then he's nothing to fear from the process of the law. Whatever its failings, our legal system is fair.'
'That's just it,' interrupted Anne. 'It's not fair --- not where foreigners are concerned. Don't you see...' Her voice rose. 'Jan's under suspicion because he's a convenient scapegoat. Not "one of us". They'll hang him, just for that.'
'Keep your voice down,' said Rowlands, uncomfortably conscious that the landlord was standing a few feet away, whistling under his breath as he polished glasses, and that the two old men at the adjacent table had fallen silent. 'The Poles are our allies. I'm sure Jan's nationality won't count against him.' Even as he said it, he wondered if it were true. The outbreaks of xenophobia at the beginning of the war against those of German descent, and indeed anyone  who sounded 'foreign', which had resulted in the mass internment of suspected 'spies' --- some of them German Jews --- told him that Anne's fears were far from groundless. 'So what do you want me to do?' he said. 'Your Group Captain Forrester's hardly going to agree to talk to a mere civilian like myself about what's really a military affair.'
'No, but you could talk to the police on Jan's behalf. You do have some influence there,' she said. Which was true --- up to a point, thought Rowlands, if his long-standing friendship with Chief Inspector Douglas of the Metropolitan Police (recently promoted to superintendent) could be said to give him influence. 'Alasdair Douglas is based in London,' he said. 'I don't know anyone in the Suffolk police force.' Besides which, he thought, if Wawrzkowicz was put on trial, it would be a court martial, surely? He didn't think it necessary to point this out to his daughter, however. One thing at a time. Anne gave an impatient sigh. 'Inspector Douglas'll have contacts here, though, surely? Please, Daddy, you're my only hope. We've got to get justice for Jan. He didn't do this...'
'No. Of course not.' But it begged the question, thought Rowlands, that if Jan Wawrzkowicz didn't kill Jonny Bly, then who did?
Anne must have looked at her watch, for she gave a gasp, and jumped up. 'I've got to go. If I'm late for roll-call, Sergeant Venables'll have my guts for garters. We'll have to carry this on tomorrow... I'll try and get away after breakfast. You'll be staying the night here, won't you, Daddy? The pub does rooms.'
'All right. I'll see what I can do.' Even if he were to leave straight away, he couldn't hope to be back in Brighton until well after midnight, Rowlands realised. A room at the King's Head seemed like the best option. Anne dropped  a kiss on his cheek. 'I knew you wouldn't let me down. Now I must dash...'
'Wait. When and where are we going to meet tomorrow? I can't just waltz into an RAF camp and ask to see the group captain.'
'You're right --- I'll have to come and find you. I'll try and slip out as soon as possible after morning parade. Failing that, I'll leave word at the gate as to when I'll be able to meet. It's about five minutes' walk along the main road. Anyone'll direct you. And Rex will bring you there safely, won't you, Rexie boy?' As she bent down to pat the dog, the door opened to admit a crowd of RAF men. That they were discussing the murder was immediately obvious.
'...sooner they hang the blighter, the better.'
'Yes, poor old Jonny. He didn't deserve this...'
Of the group must have spotted Anne, for another voice said sharply, 'Why, if it isn't our little femme fatale! I hope you're feeling proud of yourself, sweetie? It isn't every girl who can say she's walking out with a murderer.'
'He's not a murderer,' said Anne. 'Yes, if it weren't for you, poor Jonny might still be alive,' said her tormenter, ignoring this. 'But you had to... to fraternise with that... that scum.'
'That's enough,' said Rowlands, getting to his feet. Beside him, Rex let out a low growl. 'And who are you?' sneered the young man. 'Another of Lady Anne's conquests?'
'I'm her father. And you'd better drop that tone.' Rowlands unfastened Rex's lead from the chair leg. 'Come on. I'll see you to the gate,' he said to Anne. Once outside the pub, he went on, 'That was unpleasant. You shouldn't have to put up with that sort of thing.'
'Oh, Rupert was just shooting his mouth off,' said Anne wearily. 'Everyone's on edge, that's all. I mean, the fliers are, at the best of times, and this has only made it worse.'
'Even so, that lad had no business to speak to you like that.'
'Rupert was Jonny's closest friend. They were at school together. And Cambridge, I think. Hardly surprising he's upset.'
'No, but...' Rowlands let it go. 'So who's in charge here?' he said. 'Assuming they'll agree to talk to me...'
'Group Captain Forrester is the OC. He'll have given the order for Jan's arrest --- even though he wasn't actually on the base, at the time the... the shooting happened. They mostly live out, the top brass... the married ones, that is. His wife's an awfully nice sort. She gave a tea party for all the new girls in my section...' She broke off, as if momentarily distracted by thoughts of that happier occasion, months before, when she'd been a 'new girl'. The group captain's not a bad sort either,' she went on. 'People say he's got a bit of a short fuse, but he's never lost his temper with me.'
'What makes you think he'll agree to see me?' asked Rowlands, wondering anew at his daughter's refusal to be deterred by the not-inconsiderable obstacles in her way. 'He doesn't know me from Adam.' During the brief pause that followed, Rowlands became aware of just how silent the night around them was, with the crunch of their footsteps on the metalled road the loudest sound. 'He's heard about you,' said Anne at last. 'Heard about me? What do you mean?'
'He knows you're a detective.' Then, as he began to protest: 'It's no good saying you're not. You solved all those cases --- you know you did! That murder in Cambridge and... all the others. I'll never forget,' she added, under her breath, 'the time you saved me.'
'Anne...' He'd hoped she'd forgotten that dreadful affair. She'd been so young at the time. 'Let me finish,' she said. 'It was at Mrs Forrester's tea party that it came out... The GC had just looked in for a minute. She... Mrs Forrester... was asking us about our families. It's not often we get the chance to talk about ourselves and so... well, some of us got a bit carried away. Daphne Warburton was swanking about her father being a KC, and... and I couldn't bear it any longer, so I said, 'I imagine my father'll have put some work his way. He's a detective, working with the metropolitan police...'
'Oh Anne, you didn't...'
'I certainly did! Why shouldn't I be proud of you?'
'No reason at all,' he said. He hoped, but did not say, that his daughter's innocent boasting would have been dismissed as schoolgirlish fantasy by the group captain and his wife, both of whom were probably well-used to hearing such stuff from their young charges, all of them missing their families. '"Detective", indeed! He wondered ---but again, did not ask --- whether she'd mentioned that this famous detective was blind. 
'Here's where I get off,' said Anne. Because they had now reached the entrance to the airfield. Rowlands kissed his daughter goodnight, then waited as her pass was checked by the guard. 'See you tomorrow,' she called, as she was admitted within the gates. 'See you,' he replied, finding nothing incongruous about this form of words. But as he turned back in the direction from which he had come, with Rex leading the way, his heart was heavy. Just what had his beloved Anne got herself mixed up in?

### Chapter Three ###

Next morning Rowlands awoke early, as he always did in a strange place. The room he'd been given at the King's Head was was plain but comfortable, and he'd slept remarkably well, considering how much was weighing on his mind. Returning the previous night to the pub, he'd prepared himself for more of the angry remarks which had been directed at his daughter; but when he entered the bar, there'd been no more than a few muttered words he'd chosen not to hear. Having no wish to engage further with the airmen, he'd settled himself in an adjacent room to eat his supper of mutton stew, before telephoning his wife to say that he wouldn't be returning until the next day.
Now, having washed, shaved, and dressed, he descended to the same little parlour, and ordered breakfast. This, again, turned out to be much better than expected: fresh eggs were still to be obtained in this part of the world, evidently, and the bacon was thickly sliced and well-grilled. 'Wife's brother runs a farm near St Neot's,' said the landlord, when Rowlands commented on its excellence. 'Sends us a flitch of bacon every Christmas.' Having accompanied this substantial repast with two slices of toast and as many cups of strong tea, Rowlands felt ready to face whatever the day would bring. He was not unduly surprised that Anne had yet to put in an appearance. From the sound of it, the WAAFs were kept pretty busy with drilling and training exercises, in addition to their everyday tasks, whatever those were.
So it was without any sense of foreboding that he put on his coat and hat, and affixed Rex's lead (the latter having made short work of his own breakfast of stewed lights), before setting out along the road they'd walked the night before. Only when he'd reached the gate, and stated his business to the distinctly unimpressed sentry, did Anne's non-appearance start to seem significant. 'Want to see the group captain, do yer?' said the man, in a more belligerent tone than might have seemed appropriate to what was, after all, a not unreasonable request. 'Well yer can't and that's flat.'Ee's got a lot on his plate at present. Fact is, there's a flap on...'
'I assume it's about what happened the night before last?' said Rowlands. 'The killing of Mr Bly.'
''Ere! What d'you know about that?' demanded the other suspiciously. 'Maybe you had better come in... and that dog of yours too.' He opened the gate --- a heavy-duty wire-mesh structure --- to allow the visitor through. 'You just stop there,' said the soldier sternly. 'Need to talk to my sergeant about this.'
Beside the gate was a hut, into which the guard now entered. Rowlands heard him dial a number, then speak into the telephone. 'Sarge? Woolcott here. Got a bloke at the gate says he want a word with the group captain.' A brief pause followed, during which the man listened to what was said at the other end of the line. Then he stuck his head out of the door of the sentry-hut. 'What did you say your name was?'
Rowlands told him. He repeated this to his superior officer, then listened to the response. 'Roger that, Sarge. I'll tell 'im. They're sending someone to take you to HQ,' he said, having replaced the receiver. 'Seems the powers-that-be know all about you.' He seemed friendlier now that official sanction had been given to Rowlands's visit --- or maybe it was the seemingly universal appeal of Rex the dog that had softened his previous antagonism. 'Fine animal,' he remarked, as he bent to fondle Rex's ears. 'Intelligent, too, I shouldn't wonder.'
'Oh, he is,' agreed Rowlands, as Rex --- as if to demonstrate this --- emitted a low bark, by way of signalling that someone was approaching. This proved to be the promised escort. 'At ease, Corporal,' he said to the guard, who had sprung to attention at the officer's arrival. 'Flying Officer Heathcote at your service --- Mr Rowlands, isn't it? You're to come with me, sir.'
A few minutes' walk brought them to a gated compound, where, having passed by another sentry, they entered a building Rowlands guessed must be administrative offices. Like most of the buildings at Mildenhall, as he was later to discover, it was walled-in with sandbags --- a necessary precaution against aerial bombardment. In an outer office, a battery of WAAFs sat briskly typing. Telephones rang and were answered. 'Go straight through,' sang out one of the secretaries. 'He's waiting for you.'     
In the inner office, they found the group captain. He turned out to be a man of around Rowland's own age --- early fifties --- with a brusque, but not unpleasant, manner. With him were two other men, whom he introduced as Wing Commander Hawkins and Squadron Leader Templeton. 'Glad you could join us,' he said, as if this were a social call and not a meeting brought about by a suspicious death. 'Your daughter said you might be persuaded to help us with this deplorable affair... which, given this morning's events, would be a blessing,' he added, reaching down to pat the dog. 'Good boy, good fellow,' he murmured; then went on, in a grimmer tone: 'Yes, it's a bad business, this. Having one of one's men killed is bad enough, without this latest development... I don't know what I'm going to say to young Bly's parents,' he went on. 'They'll have every right to demand my head for mishandling the situation...'
'I'm afraid I don't follow,' said Rowlands, interrupting this tirade. 'Anne told me you'd arrested somebody for the crime.'
'So we had,' was the reply. 'Feller called Jan Wawrzkowicz (he pronounced it War-ko-witz). Bad blood between him and Bly over... well, never mind,' he added hastily. 'Usual damn-fool thing young men fall out about. Chap had a gun --- they issue them to anyone these days, and he...' 
'What kind of gun was it?' interrupted Rowlands.
'Oh. It appears to have been a standard Enfield No. 2 Mk 1 .38 calibre revolver.'
'Isn't that a British make?'
'Well, yes. But then the Poles are under British command. So it doesn't rule out the possibility that the man had such a gun in his possession.' 
'I see. Has the weapon been found?'
'Not yet. Perhaps,' said the group captain, with a faint edge of acerbity, 'I should finish telling you what happened, before we get into the finer points?'
'My apologies. Go on.' 
 'There seems to have been a quarrel, and he --- Wawrzkowicz --- must have let fly with it. Poor young Bly didn't stand a chance. Deadly shots, some of these fellers.' Again he stopped short. 'I take it there were witnesses to the fight?' said Rowlands, with the feeling that he had only been told a part of it. 'I mean --- did anyone see Warwrzkowicz fire the gun?'
'Actually not,' said the wing commander, speaking for the first time. Rowlands guessed his age to be in the mid-forties. A clipped, 'Oxford' accent. 'But several witnesses said they'd overheard a row between Bly and Wawrzkowicz (his pronunciation was more accurate that the group captain's, thought Rowlands). This was a couple of hours earlier in the Officers' Mess, where the dance was being held. Threats were made by the Pole. It's obvious that he must have been the one who shot Bly. These Poles are violent men, trained to kill... It's no good shaking your head at me, Peter,' he added to his subordinate --- Templeton, it emerged. 'You know it as well as I do. We should never have brought these people here. They've been nothing but trouble --- as recent events have proved.' 
Forrester sighed. 'I'm afraid the wing commander's right,' he said. 'I'd better put you in the picture, Mr Rowlands. Jan Wawrzkowicz was part of a crack SOE squad. Resistance fighters --- Polish, Ukrainians, Dutch. They're based... well, you don't need to know where. Undergoing training, so that we can drop them back in occupied territory.'
 'And good riddance,' muttered Hawkins. 'These men are trained in all the dark arts --- sabotage, armaments, transmitting radio messages --- the works. Unfortunately, they're also adept at killing.'
'Well,' said the group captain in a reasonable tone. 'They have to be, you know.'
'Yes, yes,' was the reply. 'It's just a pity one of them chose to practise his skills on young Bly.'
'I think we're all agreed that it's a complete disaster,' said Forrester. 'The fact is, Mr Rowlands, I promised myself I'd get justice for the poor young feller, if it was the last thing I'd do. Least I could do for his bereaved parents, don't y'know? So when I heard what had happened, I put out a general order for Wawrzkowicz's arrest. Got hold of the blighter and threw him in the lock-up. All set for a quick court martial and a date with the hangman. Next thing I knew, he'd broken out. Overpowered the guard and tied him up with his own braces. Lucky he didn't kill him, I suppose. Anyway, he got clean away. Now there's a ruthless killer on the loose, and we've no idea what he'll do next.'
'I still don't see where I come in,' said Rowlands.
'Your daughter said you'd got form in this kind of thing,' said the group captain. 'Tracking down murderers, I mean. She mentioned that affair in Cambridge. And those Dublin murders. My wife's a second cousin of Lord Castleford. That business was very neatly handled,' he added, referring to a case, some years before, with which Rowlands had been closely involved. 'I was only assisting the police, in each case,' he said. 'I'm not sure I...'
'Any assistance you can give us, however small, will be welcome,' said Forrester, cutting across this protest. 'We need to catch this man, and fast, before he kills again. Yes, what is it, Sergeant?' His tone was irritable. The group captain's reputation for pepperiness had not been bestowed lightly. 'Aircraftwoman Rowlands to see you, sir,' said the sergeant who had just put his head around the door. 'Says it's urgent...'
'Does she, by Jove? Well, let her come in.' 
Anne entered, and must have saluted and stood to attention, for the group captain said, 'All right. At ease, Rowlands.'
'Sir.' She addressed not a word to her father, although he sensed she was glad to have him there. 'I gather you have something you wish to say to me?' Forrester went on. 'Yes, sir.' She drew a breath. 'He didn't do it, sir. I'm sure of it.'
'You're referring to Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz, I take it?'
'Yes, sir.'
'And what makes you so certain that he didn't kill Jonathan Bly?'
'Because I know him,' Anne replied, without hesitation. 'Jan's serious about only one thing --- restoring Poland's rightful government. It's all he talks about... all he dreams about. He'd never get drawn into a stupid quarrel about... about nothing important, and jeopardise everything he's worked for.'
'That's as may be...' began Forrester; but Anne wasn't finished. 'No one actually saw him shoot Jonny Bly,' she went on. 'It was just assumed he had, because...' Again, she broke off, this time remaining silent. But the group captain hadn't missed the inference. 'If you're suggesting, Aircraftwoman Rowlands, that your friend was arrested because he's a foreigner, then I'm afraid you're speaking out of turn. You are not, I might add, in full possession of the facts, and so...'
'I know that Jan was engaged in secret work,' she interrupted. 'He didn't tell me any more than that, of course, but he'd never have lost control like that, and risked giving away the whole mission.'
'That's enough!' interrupted the wing commander. 'You're being insubordinate.'
'No, let her speak,' sighed Forrester. 'So you're telling us you knew about Wawrzkowicz's secret work?' he said to Anne. 'Only that whatever he was doing couldn't be discussed --- with me, or anyone else,' she replied. 'As I said, Jan was passionately committed to the Polish cause. He'd never have done anything to undermine it.'
'Then why did he get into a row with young Bly on Saturday night?' demanded Hawkins. 'There were plenty of witnesses to that, I can assure you!'
'I...' For once, Anne seemed at a loss for words. 'I don't know. Jonny was drunk. He... he made certain accusations. I don't think he liked the fact that I was friends with Jan.'
'Evidently not,' said the wing commander coldly. 'He was overheard shouting "Why don't you clear off and leave her alone?" He meant you, I suppose?'
'Yes.'
'According to one witness, "Wawrzkowicz started to walk away, and then Bly said, "We don't want your sort here. Go back to where you came from..."' 
'I can quite see,' said the group captain, in a conciliatory tone, 'why your friend was feeling angry.'
'Even so,' put in Rowlands. 'It was hardly grounds for murder.'
'One would have thought not. And yet, if Wawrzkowicz didn't kill Bly, then who did? That's the question.' The telephone on Forrester's desk rang. 'Yes?' A voice quacked at the other end of the line. 'Well, what d'you expect me to do about it?' said the group captain. The voice quacked again. 'All right, all right. I'll send somebody.' He replaced the heavy receiver in its cradle. 'That was Station 43,' he said. 'They've searched the house from top to bottom. Not a sign of him. But some items are missing. Boots, a flying jacket. A sleeping-bag, too. It's our man, all right --- gone to ground, I shouldn't wonder,' he added, with gloomy resignation. 'Want me to organise a search?' said the wing commander. 
'I suppose you'd better. Start from there...'
'Station 43?'
'Exactly so. Perhaps you should take Mr Rowlands with you,' added the group captain. 'See if he has any ideas for tracking down a man who doesn't want to be found.'
'Let me go, too, sir,' begged Anne. 'I'm the only one who knows him... apart from his comrades, of course. I... I could talk to him.'
'Always supposing you find him,' was the reply. 'I suppose it can't hurt,' he went on, as the wing commander started to object. 'I can't leave the base, and I don't imagine you'll want to waste too much time on this, Hawkins --- nor you, Templeton. If Aircraftwoman Rowlands thinks she knows where to find him...'
'I don't,' said Anne. 'I just want to make sure that, when he is found...' Rowlands, who had got to his feet when the other men did, put a warning hand on his daughter's arm. The past twenty minutes or so had shown him a side to Anne he'd never seen before: a fearless, outspoken side, But there was a time to keep silent, he thought. Throwing unwarranted accusations of unfair bias around would not help her case --- or that of the man she loved.

The staff car was waiting outside when the three of them left the group captain's office. Hawkins got in the front with the driver, leaving father and daughter to climb in the back of the vehicle. Rex jumped in after them, and sat quietly on the floor at Rowlands's feet. Nothing of any importance was said during the drive, which took a little over half an hour, by Rowlands's watch. At last the car came to a stop, and the driver rolled down his window. 'Wing Commander Hawkins to see Colonel Pennington,' he said to the guard, in reply to the latter's challenge. 
As the gates to what Rowlands guessed must be 'Station 43' swung open, Anne, who was sitting beside him, gave a gasp. 'Impressive, isn't it?' said  Hawkins. 'More of a palace than a house, wouldn't you say? Grounds are by Capability Brown. Not that the grounds --- or the house itself --- are looking their best, just now.' The truth of this was revealed as they proceeded slowly along the carriage drive, which was full of ruts and potholes. At last they came to a standstill. 'One thing I want to make clear,' said the wing commander. 'This place doesn't exist. You've never heard of it and you've never set foot here.'
'Understood,' said Rowlands. They got out. 'It really is a beautiful house,' murmured Anne to her father. 'Jan never told me it was like this.'
In the porch, two men waited. 'Wing Commander. Good of you to come.'
'Colonel. This is Mr Rowlands.' He didn't introduce Anne. 'All right, Perks.' This was to the driver. 'You can take fifteen minutes.'
'This is Captain Fitzpatrick,' said the colonel. 'He oversees our training programme. So he knows all there is to know about day-to-day goings-on here, don't you, Reggie? I'll lead the way, shall I? Jolly nice animal,' he added, as Rex made to follow, leading Rowlands after him. 'See how he picks up his cue?'
They entered what Rowlands judged --- from the sudden increase in the volume of space overhead ---  to be a large entrance hall. 'Grand, isn't it?' said Pennington, confirming this impression. 'This was the Great Hall, of course --- back when the place was first built. Original building goes back to the sixteenth century, although it was extensively rebuilt during the reign of Charles II. Much of the interior woodwork's Robert Adam. We've had to cover it up, for the duration.' He gave a short bark of laughter. 'Can't have our national treasures wrecked by a lot of Polish bandits... which, believe me, some of these fellers are. This way, gentlemen.' 
Again, Anne seemed to have become invisible --- a fact which didn't stop her following the men through an archway and along a corridor, off which a series of rooms opened. From some of these, the rattle of typewriters could be heard; from others, came the low rumble of male voices. 'In here,' said the colonel, as they reached the end of the corridor. 'Lord Braybrooke's the present owner. This used to be his private sitting-room. That's his grandfather up on the wall. Cheery looking cove, isn't he? Take a pew, gentlemen...' Then, apparently noticing Anne for the first time: 'Fetch a chair for the young lady, Reggie.'
When they were all seated, a brief silence ensued. Colonel Pennington cleared his throat. 'So,' he said. 'This Wawrzkowicz feller. Gone AWOL, as I told the group captain. I've had the house and grounds searched, but to no avail, I'm afraid. One of the first things these fellers are taught is how to make themselves scarce --- eh, Reggie?'
Captain Fitzpatrick agreed that this was the case. 
'You're aware that he's wanted for murder?' said Hawkins. 'I don't doubt it,' was the reply. 'Most of these chaps are trained killers. Have to be. Some of 'em have spent time in camps --- German or Russian, it matters not. Brutalises a man. And those fellers who haven't learned to kill in order to survive in their home country soon pick it up in the course of their training here.'
'Jan didn't kill anybody,' said Anne. There was a moment's startled silence, then two men spoke at once: 'Aircraftwoman Rowlands!' That was the wing commander. 'And just who are you, young lady?' --- which was the colonel. 'I know Jan Wawrzkowicz,' said Anne, ignoring the warning implied in her superior officer's intervention. 'He's a patriot, not a murderer.'
Rowlands judged it was time he spoke up: 'Colonel Pennington,' he said. 'Might it be possible to take a look at Wawrzkowicz's sleeping quarters --- and perhaps talk to some of his comrades? They might have ideas as to where he's gone.'
'May I ask what your authority in this matter is?'
'I'm an interested party, that's all,' began Rowlands; then Anne interrupted: 'My father has worked with the metropolitan police on several important murder enquiries. He also has contacts in...'
'Anne!' said Rowlands sharply. 'That's enough.' His contacts in the secret service were not for discussion --- by her, or anybody else. 'I have worked with the police, on a number of occasions,' he said to Pennington. 'In a strictly unofficial capacity.'
The colonel considered this for a moment. 'Very well,' he said. 'I'll have you taken to Wawrzkowicz's quarters, in the Old Nursery. He shares them with five other men. You might start by talking to them.' Hawkins must have shown by look or gesture just what he thought of that, for the army officer went on: 'Got any better ideas, old man? If so, I'd like to hear them.' Hawkins made no reply; but he rose at the same time as the others, and started to make for the door. 'No, you stay here, wing commander,' said Pennington. 'I want a word about... well, some rather worrying developments concerning some of our recent missions... Fitzpatrick can show Mr Rowlands and Aircraftwoman Rowlands the way. See if you can round up a few of Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz's chums, will you?' he added to Fitzpatrick. 'Koprowski, Wieroński, Wejtko, and Osmecki are the ones you want. And Czarnecki, if you can find him...'
'Captain Czarnecki's leading a training operation in the woods,' said Fitzpatrick. 'I don't know about the others.'
'Well, see who you can find,' the colonel replied. 'One thing,' he went on, this time addressing Rowlands: 'Wing Commander Hawkins will have told you that our work here is Most Secret. Most of these men have already risked their lives by coming here, and will continue to do so up until and after they leave. I hope I don't need to say more?'
'No,' said Rowlands. 'I can assure you that nothing I'm told which doesn't directly affect the question of Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz's whereabouts will go any further.'
'Good show. Carry on, Fitzpatrick.' With that, Rowlands knew they were dismissed. With Anne beside him on one side and Rex on the other, he followed the young officer out into the corridor, and back the way they'd come, until they arrived once more in the Great Hall. 'Up here,' said Fitzpatrick, leading the way up a broad staircase to the first floor. If Rowlands had initially had doubts about letting his daughter accompany him on this reconnaissance mission, these were dispelled when she fell into easy conversation with their guide. 'What a heavenly place to work!' she began. 'Not at all what I'm used to... Although don't you sometimes get lost, in all these corridors? I know I would.'
'It does take a bit of getting used to, when one first arrives,' said Fitzpatrick. 'But one soon settles in. The men are a decent crowd, on the whole. I don't mean the Poles, but our own chaps, you know. Most of 'em are billeted in the stable block...' He broke, off, as if he'd said too much. Anne, however, continued her artless prattle, as if she hadn't noticed the indiscretion. 'Well, I think it's marvellous... all these rooms stuffed full of antique furniture and paintings. Quite romantic, really.'
'Oh, the really valuable stuff has been locked away,' said Fitzgerald. 'The owner --- Lord Braybrooke --- only lent the house to the War Office for the duration, you know. 'So we --- the army, that is --- are obliged to take good care of it. Not that it stops some of these fellows (it was evident he meant the Polish contingent) from playing silly buggers with thunder-flashes and so on...'  Again he broke off. Rowlands guessed that if he had not been there, Anne could have got a great deal more information out of the young man, in his efforts to impress her.   
 They ascended a staircase to the second floor, passing rooms from which came the sound of voices reciting German phrases in unison: 'Bier, bitte.' 'Brötchen, bitte.' 'Wie komme ich am Besten zum Hauptbahnhof?'
'One of our language classes,' said Fitzpatrick unnecessarily. From another room, came the the distinctive sound of morse code being tapped out. This he did not explain, but it struck Rowlands that operating a wireless must be an important part of the training here. They came at last to a door. 'The Old Nursery,' said Fitzpatrick, opening it. 'All right, at ease,' he added, to the two men who'd jumped to their feet, as the captain and his party entered. 'Osmecki. Wejtko. This gentleman's got a few questions for you.'
A rapid exchange ensued, in what Rowlands guessed must be Polish, as one of the men conveyed this information to the other. 'Speak English!' said Fitzpatrick sharply. 'They're quite capable of it, you know,' he added to Rowlands. 'Only they prefer their own lingo... Now then, you men. Attention, if you please. Mr Rowlands, they're all yours.'
'Thank you,' said Rowlands, thinking this an awkward beginning. 'I expect you already know that your comrade, Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz, is missing?'
'Tak. We search for him. We do not find.' said one of them --- whether it was Osmecki or Wejtko was as yet unclear. 'When did you last see Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz?' There was a pause before the one who'd spoken first replied: 'See him? I do not see him. Like I said, he is gone. Zniknął,' he added, in his own language, and the other man laughed. 'Mr Rowlands means when was the last time you saw him --- as you well know, Osmecki,' put in Fitzpatrick. 'Just answer the question.'
   'It is two days since I see him --- Wawrzkowicz,' said Osmecki. 'That is, I think, Saturday. He gives me a lift to the pub --- the Red Lion --- on his motorbike. He is going to see a girl, he tells me. This is the last time I see him.'
'Thank you,' said Rowlands, guessing that the 'girl' in question was Anne, but not wanting to enquire further, in case it turned out not to be. But it was Anne herself who put the question: 'Did he mention this girl's name?'
'Nie. No,' was the reply. 'She is beautiful, he says.'
'Ładna dziewczyna,' put in Wejtko, laughing softly. 'And did he mention where he was meeting this young lady?' Osmecki must have shaken his head, for Fitzpatrick snapped, 'Speak up, man!' 
'He does not say. He "drops" me at the pub --- that is what you say, isn't it? "Drops"? Then he goes away on his motorbike. I do not see him again.'
'You've been very helpful, Mr Osmecki,' said Rowlands. 'If you remember anything else --- or if Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz gets in touch --- perhaps you could telephone me at the King's Head pub, in Mildenhall? I'll be there for the next couple of days.' Because he knew that the likelihood of  his being able to return to Brighton before tomorrow at the earliest was becoming increasingly remote. If Wawrzkowicz were to be found --- and if, he, Rowlands, were to play any part in finding him --- he would need to remain in the area for at least the next twenty-four hours. Forty-eight, if he were being realistic.
'If Wawrzkowicz does get in touch, I want you to come straight to me,' said Fitzpatrick, undoing whatever trust had built up between the Poles and Rowlands. 'Do you understand, Osmecki?'
'Oh, yes,' was the reply. 'I understand very well.'
'Dobry pies,' said Wejtko, as Rowlands and his companions turned to go. 'What's that?' said Fitzpatrick suspiciously. 'He says "Good dog",' replied Osmecki, with a laugh. 'He likes dogs.'
'They're a close-mouthed crew,' opined the captain, as the three of them, accompanied by Rex, returned to the ground floor of the great house. 'I knew you wouldn't get much out of those two. Thick as thieves, they are.'
'What about the other men Colonel Pennington mentioned?'
'Well, Czarnecki won't be back till nightfall,' said the officer. 'But we'll see if we can track down the other two. Midday,' he observed, as the musical chimes of large clock resounded from the hall below. 'That's a bit of luck. There's a good chance we'll find them in the mess hall.'
This was a section of the Great Hall, partitioned off from the rest, where around forty or fifty men were assembled at trestle tables, arranged to form three sides of a square. What conversation Rowlands could hear, above the scraping of knives and forks against plates, was in Polish. 'Ah, those are the men we want,' said Fitzpatrick, in a satisfied tone. 'Koprowski and Wierónski. If you'll follow me, I'll perform the necessary introductions.' Which was rather what Rowlands was afraid of --- but he had no choice but to let the brash young officer lead the way across the room to where the two Polish officers were sitting. 'At ease, you men,' he said, as they started to get to their feet. 'You'll have to put off having your lunch for a few minutes. This gentleman's got some questions for you.' 
'Questions?' said one of the men, suspiciously. 'What kind of questions?'
'Oh, nothing that need concern you,' was the reply, to Rowlands's private annoyance. 'Lieutenant Wierónski only joined us two weeks ago,' Fitzpatrick explained. 'Don't suppose he'll have much to tell us. But Captain Koprowski's one of our old hands. He and Wawrzkowicz trained together in Scotland, didn't you, Tomasz? So he'll be able to give you as good an idea as any of what his chum's been up to...'
'Well, I don't know about that,' replied the officer, whose English was evidently better than that of most of his comrades. 'Jan's a secretive fellow, you know! Perhaps,' he went on, 'we could talk outside? I rather fancy a cigarette, and they do frown on one lighting up in here. Terrible if all that lovely woodwork went up in smoke, don't you think?'


### Chapter Four ###

Outside, it was still bitterly cold. It struck Rowlands that it was the worst time of year for anyone hiding out in the open. He hoped that, whatever Wawrzkowicz had, or hadn't done, he'd found adequate shelter. 'So,' said Koprowski, having lit cigarettes for himself and his friend. 'You wish to ask me if I know where Jan has gone? The answer is, I do not. But I can tell you one thing --- you will not find him, if he does not wish to be found. He escaped from the Russians in '40, and from the Germans in '41. Breaking out of an RAF lock-up would have been child's play.'
'How do you know where he was being held?' demanded Fitzpatrick. 'Has he been in touch?'
'My dear fellow, of course not. He would not take the risk.'
'Then how...?'
'Such information gets around,' said Koprowski. 'We are a small community here. We take an interest in anything affecting one of our number, eh, Wictor?' The other man laughed, and agreed. 'Message understood,' said Rowlands. 'Then you'll be as interested as I am in clearing Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz's name of the stain of murder.'
There was silence for a moment. 'I was under the impression,' said Koprowski at last, 'that it was to arrest Jan for murder that you are here.'
'You're mistaken,' said Rowlands. 'I'm not a policeman. I just want to ask your friend some questions.'
The other laughed softly. 'That is what a policeman would say. Although I saw at once that you are not an ordinary policeman. The dog gives you away, of course. And the fact that you do not meet my gaze.'
Rowlands smiled. 'Full marks for observation, Captain Koprowski. Yes, it's true that I have worked with the police in the past. But I'm here now in a private capacity, isn't that so, Captain Fitzpatrick?' Fitzpatrick grunted an agreement. 'Therefore, in the absence of Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz, perhaps you would answer some questions?'
'Ask away.'
'When did you last see Jan Wawrzkowicz?'
'See him or speak to him?' He was playing for time, as they both knew. 'Either will do,' replied Rowlands. 'Very well.' The Polish office took another drag on his cigarette. 'I last saw him at around three o'clock this morning.' Fitzpatrick gave an exclamation, which the speaker ignored. 'He had entered the room where we were sleeping, I and my fellow Chichociemni...' --- the word was unfamiliar to Rowlands --- 'Or, in my case, not sleeping.'
'Why didn't you mention this earlier?' said Fitzpatrick furiously. 'Nobody asked me,' was the cool reply. 'I did not know at the time that Jan had been accused of shooting the Englishman. All I knew was, he was awake, as I was awake. We did not speak. He made a sign to me to remain silent, and so I did.'
'And you let him go, just like that?' cried the exasperated Fitzpatrick. 'Naturally,' said Koprowski. 'Why should I stop him? For all I knew, he was engaged on a mission... to break into a police station, perhaps... or to steal an army lorry. We often have to carry out such missions, as part of our training,' he added, for Rowlands' benefit. 'How was I to know he was running away?'
This was unanswerable, and so Rowlands let it drop. At least they now had a rough time-frame for Wawrzkowicz's disappearing act. If he left the house sometime after three a.m., he'd have had under two hours before it started to get light. He'd want to get himself under cover before then. So it was likely he was still in the vicinity, thought Rowlands --- given that the roads and railways would now be under surveillance by the authorities. 'Thank you, Captain Koprowski,' he said. 'You've been very helpful.'  He was sure, as he spoke, that  Koprowski was hiding something. But then none of the men he'd spoken to since his arrival at 'Station 43' had been entirely straight with him.
'Captain Koprowski. You're the last person to have seen Jan. I want to know... how did he seem?' Anne's voice betrayed no sign of the anxiety she must be feeling. 'Was he agitated or upset?'
'He was just as usual,' replied Koprowski. 'Cool as a cucumber, as you English say.' He didn't seem surprised at Anne's question, nor query her right to ask it. Perhaps, thought Rowlands, the fact that she was a part of his friend's life was not unknown to him. 'Thank you,' said Anne. 'That's good to know.'
'If Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz does make contact,' said Rowlands, 'maybe you could persuade him to get in touch --- either with one of his superior officers, or, if he prefers, with me. I'll be staying at the King's Head in Mildenhall for the next couple of days. It won't do his case any good, you know, running away like this. Tell him that.'
'I am unlikely to have the opportunity,' said the Polish officer. 'And if I did, he would not listen to me. It was a pleasure to meet you,' he said to Anne. 'Jan has spoken of you.' With that, he and his fellow officer took themselves off. 'We must see if there is still some food left for us,' he said. 'Rabbit stew today, I think. After that, we have lectures to attend. How to strip down a Bren-gun, and deal with a UXB... My studies in Philosophy at Warsaw University did not prepare me for this, unfortunately.'
The roar of an engine coming along the driveway brought further conversation to an end. The heavy vehicle --- an army lorry, Rowlands guessed --- came to a juddering halt in front of the house, and a someone --- a young woman, it became apparent --- jumped out and saluted smartly. 'Driver Hotchkiss reporting for duty, sir,' she said to Fitzpatrick. 'At ease,' he replied. 'Yes, you'll be wanted shortly. We'd better go and find the wing commander,' he added to Rowlands. 'He'll be wanting to be getting back, I shouldn't wonder.'
In Colonel Pennington's office, an orderly had just brought in his lunch on a tray. It smelt appetising. No rabbit stew for the top brass, thought Rowlands. 'Thank you, Hemings,' said the colonel; then, to the wing commander: 'Are you sure you chaps won't stay for a spot of fodder?'
'Thanks, but we're expected back at HQ,' said Hawkins. 'Looks like a nice piece of beefsteak, too. Rather better than the kind of fare they'll be giving us, I warrant.'
'Yes, we do ourselves quite well here,' replied the other. 'Get what you needed?' he went on, this time addressing Rowlands. Before he could reply, Fitzpatrick burst out indignantly, 'Koprowski admits he saw Wawrzkowicz at three o'clock this morning...'
'Does he indeed?' Pennington's tone was one of mild surprise. 'I don't suppose Wawrzkowicz happened to say where he was going?'
'No such luck,' said Rowlands, forestalling another interruption from the young man. 'I've asked if he --- and the other men I spoke to --- would telephone me if Wawrzkowicz makes contact.'
'Good idea,' said Pennington. 'Although I'm afraid it's unlikely anything will come of it. These chaps place loyalty to one another above everything --- except loyalty to the cause.'
'The "cause" being the Polish cause, I take it?'
'Correct. Well, if you're done here, gentlemen, I have a steak to eat.'
'Yes, don't let it get cold,' said Hawkins. 'We should go, Mr Rowlands.'
'There is one thing I'd like to ask,' said Rowlands, ignoring this summons. 'It was something Captain Koprowski said. He called his fellow partisans by a strange name. Cheeho... something.'
'Chichociemni. It means "silent and unseen".' The colonel laughed. 'Describes these fellows rather well, I think! Tell you what, if I were the enemy, I wouldn't care to meet one of them on a dark night, eh, Hawkins?'
The wing commander gave a rather pained laugh. 'No indeed. Well, we'd better leave you to your lunch, Colonel. I'll tell the group captain what you've told me about the, ah, missions that have gone awry. But I'm not sure there's much to be done. It's a matter for the Poles themselves, I'd have thought.' He didn't expand on this, and Pennington made no further comment, but fell to eating his steak. It struck Rowlands that there might be more to Wawrzkowicz's disappearance than he'd been told --- and more than just a falling-out over a girl to account for the murder at Mildenhall. 
  
As they drove back along the drive, bumping over the potholes (doubtless caused by the passing back and forth of heavy military vehicles, thought Rowlands), the shouts of men playing football came from somewhere behind the house. 'They like to keep them active,' observed Hawkins. 'Need to be pretty fit to do what's expected of them.'
'Which is what, exactly?' asked Rowlands, wondering if he'd get an answer. 'Jumping out of aeroplanes, for one,' was the reply. 'And... well, all the rest.' He didn't expand on this, but Rowlands knew enough about 'special operations' to guess that 'all the rest' would include every available tactic for survival --- from unarmed combat to weapons handling. Keeping fit was only the start of it.
The rest of the drive back to Mildenhall passed without further conversation, which suited Rowlands, still thinking over what he had learned at 'Station 43'. Anne, too, was quiet. Perhaps, thought her father, she had decided to keep her counsel in the presence of her superior officer, whose patience, in the face of the young woman's recent interventions, might well have started to run out. Nor was Hawkins the only senior RAF officer of whom Anne risked falling foul. As the Hillman drew up in front of the service block, and its passengers got out --- the wing commander leading the way towards the group captain's office --- a voice rang out: 'Aircraftwoman Rowlands! Report to me at once!'
'Oh, Lor', ' murmured Anne to her father. 'It's the Hellcat.'
This unpromising soubriquet proved itself to be fully justified a moment later as the owner of the voice strode up. 'I'd like to know exactly what you've been playing at, young Rowlands,' went on this martinet. 'Not only do you fail to appear at roll-call this morning, but you absent yourself from drill, and the rest of your duties.'
'I'm sorry, m'am,' replied Anne. 'I know I should have asked permission, but...'
'Aircraftwoman Rowlands had my permission to accompany her father on a... a fact-finding tour, Section Leader Henderson,' put in Hawkins. 'So the fault is mine, for neglecting to notify you of her absence.'
'Hmph.' The woman nicknamed the 'Hellcat' seemed unimpressed by this apology. 'I suppose you'd better report to Sergeant Venables PDQ,' she said to Anne. 'I've no doubt she'll be wanting an explanation.'
'Yes, m'am.'
'You'd better tell her I know all about it,' added the section leader, in a more conciliatory tone. 'Otherwise she'll have you on extra duties for a week.'  
'Yes, m'am. Thank you, m'am,' Anne replied meekly. Without further ado, she saluted and marched off. Rowlands concealed a smile at seeing his outspoken daughter taken down a peg. When she was out of earshot, the section leader remarked mildly, 'We have to keep them up to the mark, don't we, Wing Commander? Too much depends on them, for us to let discipline lapse.'
'I quite agree,' said Rowlands. 'I was in the army once, myself.'
'You're Anne's father, I take it? ' said the Hellcat. 'Grand girl. Always the first to volunteer for unpopular duties. Bright, too. You must be proud of her...'
'I am.'
'Awful shame her getting dragged into this mess to do with the Bly boy,' she added gruffly. He agreed that it was. 'Well, must be pushing along,' said the section leader. 'Good to meet you, Mr Rowlands. Wing Commander.' She saluted. 'Section Leader.' Hawkins returned the salute. The Hellcat marched off, heels clicking smartly across the parade ground.

'Ah, Mr Rowlands --- just the man I want to see,' said Group Captain Forrester, as Rowlands and the wing commander, having navigated their way past the sentry and the wall of sandbags, walked into his office. 'I take it you haven't yet found our suspect?'
Rowlands said that they had not, but that there were a few leads he thought worth following up.
'Mr Rowlands is a detective,' Forrester went on, addressing someone else who was in the room. 'He and Hawkins here have been looking into Wawrzkowicz's movements at Station 43... But I'm forgetting my manners,' he went on. 'Let me introduce an old friend, Chief Constable Valentine. And this is Inspector Strong,' he added, as a second officer came forward to shake Rowlands's hand. 'The Chief Constable's taking an interest in the case, aren't you, Ronnie? Thinks it's his pigeon now.'
'I'm afraid there's not a doubt of it,' the other man replied. 'Seeing that our man Wawrzkowicz has gone on the run. He's a danger to the public, Forrester --- and you know it. It's no longer a case for the military courts.'
'I beg to differ,' said the group captain. 'He committed the crime on RAF territory, and he's escaped from an RAF prison...'
'Precisely,' was the reply. 'But now he's out there somewhere, and it's now the job of the police to bring him in.'
'Mr Rowlands here might disagree,' said Forrester amicably. 'Given that he doesn't believe the man did what he's accused of doing.'
'I certainly think there's room for doubt,' said Rowlands. He hesitated. 'I know you've already interviewed the witnesses to the quarrel on Saturday night, but I wondered if I might do so again? There are a few things I'm not clear about.'
'What do you think, Ronnie?' said the group captain to his friend. The other thought for a moment. 'It's irregular,' he said. 'I mean, with respect, you don't have any authority here, Mr Rowlands --- even if you have solved a few of Alasdair Douglas's trickier cases for him... Oh yes,' he laughed, seeing Rowlands' startled expression. 'News of your successes has reached as far as the wilds of East Anglia. We're not as cut off here as you might think.'
Rowlands said that he was sure of that. 'Perhaps,' he said. 'A compromise might be reached? If I could sit in on the police interviews with the witnesses --- assuming that the police are going to interview them again --- it would help me to form a picture of events... which might be of use to the investigation,' he added humbly. There was a brief silence. 'What do you think, Strong?' said the chief constable to his subordinate. 'I suppose it's all right, sir,' replied this individual dubiously. 'Very well,' said Valentine. 'I don't see that there would be any harm in your sitting in, Mr Rowlands --- on one condition.'
'Name it.'
'I'd like to hear about these leads you mention.'
'Of course. Although they're rather tentative leads at present.'
'Better than nothing,' was the reply. It was then that Forrester intervened. 'What say you to discussing all this over a bite of lunch?' he said. He touched a buzzer on his desk, and at once an orderly put his head around the door. 'Sir?' 
'Cut along to the mess, Parsons, and see if they can't rustle up lunch for five, will you?'
'Sir.'
'And see if Cook can spare  some scraps for Mr Rowlands' dog, while you're about it.'

The police interviews took place in a room adjacent to the group captain's  office --- since, as he pointed out, that was too cramped for their purposes. Here, a table had been set up, with chairs for Forrester, Hawkins, and the chief constable, and another for Inspector Strong, who would be conducting the interviews. Rowlands sat to one side of this --- as if he were umpiring a tennis match, he thought --- with Rex sitting quietly at his feet. There was a tin ashtray in the middle of the table, and as the afternoon went on, this filled up with stubs, as the room did with smoke. Rowlands, habitually attuned to such distinctions, noticed that among the usual brands --- Players, Lucky Strikes, and his own Churchman's --- there was another, more exotic, smell. 'Unusual brand,' he said, addressing the man who was smoking these --- Wing Commander Hawkins. 'What is it?'
'I have them made up at a shop I know,' said Hawkins. 'Bacon Bros., tobacconists in Cambridge. It's my own special mixture. I buy them by the boxful. Addicted to the things.'
'We all have our preferred smokes, don't we?'
The other laughed. 'We do.' It was the first time Hawkins had unbent, in Rowlands' company, and he found himself rather warming to the man. He was a bit of a stickler for the rules, it was true --- but surely that was a prerequisite for the job? You couldn't run a station like this without being something of a martinet.   
The first witness to be summoned was familiar to Rowlands from the previous night's encounter in the King's Head. It was the youth who'd been so unpleasant to Anne --- his voice, though now subdued and respectful in tone, was still instantly recognisable. 'Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff, am I right?' began the inspector, consulting a list. 'You are,' replied the other coolly; then, evidently spotting Rowlands: 'I say, what the devil's he doing here?'
'Not your concern, Moncrieff,' snapped Group Captain Forrester. 'You'll answer the questions Inspector Strong puts to you, and no more, do you read me?'
'Yes... that is, yes, sir,' stammered Moncrieff.
'Very well, Flight Lieutenant,' went on the policeman. 'I want you to tell me as much as you can recall of the events of Saturday night.'
'But I've already said all this...'
'And you'll say it again,' said Forrester, who was evidently losing patience with his star flier. 'Shouldn't keep you too long,' put in the chief constable smoothly. 'I know how busy you chaps are.'
'Sir.'
Inspector Strong resumed his questioning. 'I believe you were friends with the deceased, Jonathan Bly?'
'I was.' Moncrieff's voice sounded less steady for a moment. 'He was my navigator. Bloody good one, too.' The young man exhaled, as if trying to get a grip on himself. 'Before that, we were at school together. Same House.'
'Indeed. And Trinity College afterwards, I understand?'
'Yes.'
'So you were pretty well placed, what with being such old friends, to get an idea of Mr Bly's state of mind?'
'He didn't kill himself, if that's what you're implying,' retorted Moncrieff hotly. 'Jonny wasn't that sort. Any of the chaps'll tell you that.'
'I wasn't suggesting anything of the kind, sir,' said Strong. 'Only trying to get a feel for what went on. Seems to me you're all under a lot of strain. Stands to reason, I'd have said.'
'We do our best, Inspector,' replied Moncrieff stiffly. 
'I'm sure you do, sir. Now, to get down to specifics. I'd like you to take me through the events of Saturday evening, if you will. I know you've been over this already with the group captain here. But for the sake of argument, let's assume you're describing things for the first time.'
Rowlands knew this was a tactic the police often employed --- getting a witness to repeat himself, in order to check for discrepancies. He guessed that the inspector would have the typed record of what each witness had said on the desk in front of him. 'Why don't you start with when you arrived at the dance, and we'll take it from there?'
'All right.' Moncrieff took a minute to reflect. Then, in the monotonous tones of someone delivering a report, he began: 'We --- Flying Officers Halliday, Bly, Callender, and myself --- arrived at the Officers' Mess at around eight o'clock. We'd come from the King's Head, you see,' he added, dropping the formal tone. 'It was the birthday of one of the chaps --- Halliday's in fact --- and so we'd stopped in for a pint along the way. When we got to the mess, the dance had been going about half an hour. Apart from ourselves, there were about fifty people there. More arrived soon after. I'd say there were probably a hundred all told --- including the women, of course.'
'Ah yes,' said Inspector Strong. 'The women. WAAFs mainly, I suppose?'
'That's right. There were a few girls from the village, too. Some of the men fraternise with the locals a bit,' he added with some hauteur. 'But not you?' said Strong, in the same neutral tone he'd used throughout. 
'I'm engaged, Inspector. Although I can't see that it has any bearing on what happened on Saturday night.'
'No indeed, sir,' said Strong. 'Just trying to get a picture. You were telling us about the dance.'
'So I was. Well, as I said before, nothing much happened until about nine, when Wawrzkowicz arrived. He sort of swaggered in, looking around him as if he owned the place. Cocky blighter, if you want my opinion.'
'You think he was looking for a fight?' 
'I'm sure of it. The fellow always acted as if he thought himself a cut above every other chap. Then when Jonny said what he said...'
'Hold on a minute, will you?' said Strong, scribbling rapidly in his notebook. 'Before you tell me what it was that Mr Bly said, I'd like to go back a little way. You said you and your friends arrived at eight, having come from the pub --- is that so?' Moncrieff agreed that it was. 'And then you all got on with... whatever it is you do on these occasions. Talking to friends, and buying drinks, and perhaps asking one of the ladies to dance, am I right?' The young man said that he was. 'So what was Mr Bly doing all this time?' When Moncrieff did not reply at once, the inspector went on, 'I take it that he wasn't just glowering in a corner, waiting for his rival --- if I might call Wawrzkowicz that --- to arrive?'
'Well, no,' said Moncrieff. He sounded uncertain, and at once Rowlands pricked up his ears. 'He... I think he was playing billiards... at least for a while.   There's a room next to the mess, set up for cards and other games. Then he  must have been at the bar, because he'd got into an argument about  whether he'd paid his slate... which meant he couldn't order any more drinks until it was paid... He'd been putting it away all night, so it was probably time he called a halt, anyway. Jonny was never very good at holding his drink,' he added, again with the faintly superior note Rowlands has noticed earlier. 'I went over to see if I could sort it out with Tommy --- that's our barman --- and it was then that Wawrzkowicz came in. "What's that blighter doing here?' said Jonny --- only he didn't say "blighter"... I'm jolly well going to give him a piece of my mind.'
'What was it he said, exactly?' said the policeman. Moncrieff considered a moment. 'He said, as far as I can recall, "Look here, Wawrzkowicz, why don't you clear off? You're not wanted here." And then he --- Wawrzkowicz --- said, "You're drunk," and told him to get out of the way.'
'Did he?'
'No. He sort of of made a rush at Wawrzkowicz, but the fellow side-stepped, so that Jonny would have fallen headlong if I hadn't caught him. As Wawrzkowicz was walking off, Jonny shouted that he'd better watch himself, if he knew what was good for him, and...'
'He said that, did he? It sounds rather as if it was Bly who was threatening Wawrzkowicz and not the other way around,' observed the chief constable drily. 'It was just bravado, sir. Wawrzkowicz took it seriously, though. "You will regret those words," he said. We all heard him. That was a threat, and no mistake.'
'All right.' Inspector Strong consulted his notes. 'We'll leave it at that, for the present. I see that you left the dance at a little after midnight?'
'Yes.'
'Did you go straight to your quarters?'
'I did. I had a test flight to do first thing next day, so I didn't think I should make a night of it.'
'Quite so. According to your earlier statement, you turned in soon afterwards and slept until roll-call at six. Is that accurate?'
'If you say so.'
'And so you didn't realise your friend Mr Bly was missing until you saw his bed hadn't been slept in?'
'No.'
'I see.' Strong added a note to the sheet in front of him. 'What was your first impression when you saw that Mr Bly had not returned to the officers' quarters?'
'I'm not sure I understand what you mean, Inspector.'
'I mean what did you think had happened to him?'
'I... I'm not sure. I suppose I thought he was sleeping it off somewhere.'
'It didn't occur to you to go and look for him?'
'It didn't. I had things to do, as I've said, and so...'
'Indeed,' said the other. 'So it wasn't until later --- mid-morning, I believe you told the group captain --- that you learned that he'd been killed?'
'That's right. One of my crew told me.' Moncrieff drew a breath, as if trying to steady himself. 'Flight Sergeant Briggs, I think it was.'
'Yes, that's what it says here. All right, Flight Lieutenant,' said Strong. 'I think that's all for now. Perhaps you could ask the next man --- Flying Officer Callander --- to come in?'

### Chapter Five ###

Flying Officer 'Bingo' Callander turned out to be an amiable young man, with a good deal less side to him than Moncrieff, thought Rowlands. He answered the inspector's initial questions without hesitation, and made no reference to the fact of Rowlands' presence, although the latter recognised his voice as having belonged to one of the group in the pub the night before.
His account of Saturday night's events followed that which Moncrieff had given in almost every respect. Yes, he and the chaps had sunk a few pints at the pub earlier in the evening. They'd turned up at the mess around eight, he rather thought. The skipper... he meant Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff... had something he had to do beforehand, and so he'd peeled off, and...
'Just a minute,' said Strong. 'I'm not quite clear on this. You're saying that Moncrieff left your party at one point? Exactly what time was this?'
'I...' Callander seemed to realise that he'd put his foot in it. 'It was only for a few minutes. No more than ten, I'd say. We'd just got to the mess, when he... the skipper... said, "I've got to have a word with Wally..." He's one of the erks... ground crew, I mean. He --- the skipper --- said something about there being a problem with the magneto on D-Donald.'
'That's the crew's Lancaster,' put in Hawkins.
'Then he sloped off. I know he can't have been away for long because Tommy was still setting up the pints on the bar when he came back.'
'Thank you, Mr Callander. So --- just to be clear --- Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff arrived back at the Mess at around ten past eight, would you say?' 
'I couldn't swear to it, but around that time,' said the young man. 'I said something like, "That was quick!" and he --- the skipper --- shrugged and said, "Couldn't find the blighter."'
'All right,' said Strong. 'I think I've got that. Now, what can you tell me about this quarrel between Flying Officer Bly and Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz?'
'Well...' Callander hesitated a moment. 'To tell the truth, Inspector, I wasn't paying much attention. I got chatting to somebody... Aircraftwoman Saunders,' he admitted sheepishly. 'So it wasn't until voices started being raised that I knew anything about it. Storm in a teacup, in my opinion. Jonny was a bit pie-eyed by then. Chaps in that state tend to spout an awful lot of rot. Best forgotten.'
'Except that it wasn't forgotten, was it, Mr Callander?' put in the chief constable. 'Somebody killed him.'
'That blighter Wawrzkowicz,' said the other. 'No doubt about it, is there?'
'That's what we're trying to find out,' sighed Valentine. 'All right, Mr Callander. So you're saying you weren't paying particular attention to what was being said a few feet away from where you and this young lady were standing. You must have heard something, though. It's a large room, admittedly, but not that large.'
'Well, yes. I did hear something. You couldn't not hear, the way Jonny was going on... Lot of rot about Wawrzkowicz hanging around where he wasn't wanted...'
'Do you think Flying Officer Bly was referring to anything in particular when he made these accusations? The fact that Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz was spending time with Aircraftwoman Rowlands, for example?' 
'I don't know, sir. Might have been.' All of a sudden, Callander seemed to become aware that Rowlands was present. 'I say,' he said in an embarrassed aside to the latter. 'About last night... I hope you don't think that I went along with what the skipper was saying to Anne... about... Well, you were there. He was awfully cut up about Jonny's death, you know. We all were. But he'd no right to say... well, what he said.'
'Thank you,' said Rowlands. 'I appreciate that.' 
'What's all this?' said  Forrester sharply. 'You didn't mention anything about it, Mr Rowlands.'
'That's because there was nothing to mention,' replied Rowlands. 'Just an exchange of views, best forgotten. I'm sure my daughter would agree.'
'Hmph. If you say so.' Then, at a nod from Valentine: 'All right, Callander, the Chief Constable's finished with you now. Ask Mr Halliday to come in, will you? Halliday's the fourth officer in D-Donald's crew,' he added to the policemen. 
Of course, thought Rowlands, as the implications of this remark became clear --- the men were all part of the same flying crew: skipper, bomb aimer, navigator and now whoever was next of the seven-man team. It would have created a powerful bond between them, he guessed, recalling his own days in the army, with the fierce loyalty to one's pals and one's unit engendered by the wearing of a uniform.
'So, Mr Halliday,' said Strong, as the young man came in. 'It says here you're the wireless operator.'
'Bang on,' was the cheerful reply. Flying Officer Halliday, it soon became apparent, had a penchant for RAF slang. Yes, he agreed when questioned, he'd 'tooled along' to the pub on Saturday night, with the skipper and a few of the other 'old lags'. It had been his birthday, he added. 'Twenty! Getting my old age pension soon...' He'd realised that Bly, who'd been drinking steadily all evening, was 'shot to ribbons' when he heard him 'flanneling on' about something-or-other. It was a pity, because, when he was sober, old Jonny was a top-hole navigator.
'You heard what Flying Officer Bly said to Wawrzkowicz, I assume?' interrupted the chief constable. 'Loud and clear,' was the reply. 'He really let him have it. Told him to make himself scarce, in no uncertain fashion. "Can't you see you're not wanted here?" he said. Really worked himself into a bate, did old Jonny.'
'What happened then?' said the inspector. 'After Mr Bly said what he did, I mean.'
'Not an awful lot. Somebody --- I think it was Bingo Callander --- said to Jonny, "You've had enough, old man," and helped him towards the door. Fresh air. That's what he needed. Always helps when a chap's a bit "lit"...'
'And what of Mr Wawrzkowicz? How did he react to Mr Bly's attack?'
'With respect, Inspector, it wasn't really an "attack" --- just a few harsh words. Wawrzkowicz didn't pay much attention. He just muttered something  to Anne --- Aircraftwoman Rowlands, I mean --- about getting a drink, and then the two of them drifted over to the bar.'
'So you're saying he didn't react to what was said?'
'Oh, he reacted all right. Gave old Jonny no end of a dirty look. "We'll settle this later," he said.'
'He said that, did he?'
'Far as I can recall.'
When asked what his movements had been between midnight and four a.m., the 'Sparks' didn't hesitate. 'I was in my bunk by half-past twelve at the latest. Slept like a baby till roll-call.'
'Anyone vouch for you?'
'The rest of my crew --- or most of 'em. Jonny was off somewhere --- being sick, we all thought. If only we'd known...' He was silent a moment. 'Poor devil, he didn't deserve that, you know. Being shot like a dog... Yes, I went back to my billet, and turned in PDQ. We'd orders to report to the briefing room first thing on the Monday, so most of us were keen to enjoy the weekend  while we could. Seeing as we mightn't have another one for quite a while...'
'Thank you, Flying Officer. You can send the next man in.'

'Flight Sergeant Trescott, isn't it?' said the inspector, as this individual walked in and at the latter's request, took a seat. 'That's right.'
'You're the flight engineer in Mr Moncrieff's crew, I believe?'
'Yes, sir.' The young man hesitated. 'Leastways, I will be, once we've flown our next mission. I was with S-Sugar before she went down. Only man to make it,' he added under his breath. 
'So you're new to this particular crew, you're telling me?'
'I am, yes. Took over when Flight Sergeant Williams was invalided out...'
'Appendicitis,' put in Forrester. 'Young Williams won't be fit for another month, I'm told.'
  'Sir.' Trescott's subdued manner, combined with his soft Mancunian accent, set him apart from the more assured public school demeanour of those members of D-Donald's crew so far interviewed. Although it wasn't his accent alone that made him appear the odd man out. Perhaps, thought Rowlands, it was the horror of being the only survivor of a crash which had wiped out the rest of his crew, which had made Trescott so taciturn? 
Whatever the reason, he answered the questions put to him by the inspector in monosyllables --- a contrast to the confident manner evinced by Moncrieff, Callander, and Halliday. These three, it struck Rowlands, were all of a piece, as regarded their social background. Members of an exclusive club, consisting of those who'd been to the right schools, attended the right universities, and now found themselves part of the right 'set' in their chosen service. Wartime blurred social distinctions, as Rowlands himself had found, but it didn't erase them. 
'You attended the dance at the officers' mess on Saturday night, I understand?' said Strong.
'Yes, sir.'
'What time did you arrive?'
'Around eight, sir.'
'And how long did you stay?'
'About an hour, sir. To tell the truth, I didn't feel much like celebrating, after...' His voice tailed off. 'No, of course not,' said Strong. 'But you were present when Flying Officer Bly had his altercation with Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz?'
'Pardon, sir? Oh, you mean the Pole. Is that his name? Yes, I was there.'
'So you heard Wawrzkowicz's threat --- if that was what it was --- to Jonathan Bly?'
'I heard something of the kind, sir. Might've been a threat, like you say. Or...' The flight engineer hesitated. 'Thought it was just the Polish lad's way of shutting Bly up, sir. Not sure I'd have called it a threat, as such.' Bravo, Mr Trescott, thought Rowlands. At least someone was prepared to take the foreigner's part.
'Thank you, Trescott. I think that will be all.' The flight engineer rose to leave. 'Might I ask Mr Trescott a question?' said Rowlands, before the young man had reached the door. 'Do, by all means,' was the chief constable's reply. 'You may sit down again, Trescott.'
The flight engineer accordingly did so. 'Mr Trescott,' began Rowlands. 'You say that you left the mess around nine p.m., is that correct?'
'Yes, sir.'
'Where did you go after that?'
'I don't follow, sir.'
'I mean, it was a little early to turn in, wasn't it?'
'Oh. I get you, sir. I went for a bit of a walk. Had a smoke.'
'Did you see anybody about?' 
Rowlands was groping towards the idea that Bly's assailant might have been an outsider. Someone unconnected with the airfield, who might have had some as yet unknown reason for bearing a grudge against the young man. It was a long shot, he knew, but anything that would shift suspicion away from Jan Wawrzkowicz could only help the latter's cause. So he could not have been more surprised when Trescott said, 'Not to say as I saw anybody, sir. But I heard Mr Moncrieff (it struck Rowlands that he did not refer to him as the 'skipper'). He was in the big hangar, as I walked past. Giving Wally Pryce a piece of his mind.'
'Ah. Something to do with the aeroplane's magneto, wasn't it?
'I don't know, sir. All I heard was Moncrieff --- I mean, Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff --- shouting that he, Pryce, was going to get his fingers burnt if he wasn't careful.'
'What do you think Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff meant by that?'
'Couldn't say, sir.'
'Might he have been referring to the state of the plane?' interjected Hawkins. 
'He might've, sir. But...' Trescott hesitated. 'It's what Mr Moncrieff said next that made it sound as if it was about something else.'
'What did he say?'
'I... I didn't hear it all, because I didn't think I should be listening-in, like. It sounded like, "I won't stand for this sort of thing, Pryce. It's got to stop, do you hear?" I didn't stay to hear more,' said Trescott sheepishly.

There was silence after the flight engineer had left the room. 'Well, well,' said Forrester at last. 'It looks as if we shall have to have Mr Moncrieff in for another grilling...' He didn't sound very pleased at the prospect. 'Yes, agreed the chief constable. 'It does rather appear as if our young friend has been slightly less than forthcoming about his movements that evening. What made you think to ask Trescott about his movements?' he added to Rowlands. 
The latter shrugged.  'It was just a feeling I had that he --- Trescott --- wasn't saying all he knew. I can't really say what made me think it.'
The chief constable gave a short unamused laugh. 'All I can say, Mr Rowlands, is that we need a few more "feelings" of that nature. There are too many half-truths and evasions in this case, for my liking.' He sighed. 'Who have we got next? The rest of Moncrieff's crew, I suppose? I must say, they seem like a close-knit bunch. All knocking around together.'
'They are as a general rule,' said Forrester. 'Flying missions night after night tends to act as a bond, you know, drawing even the most standoffish men together. Means they stick up for one another, too,' he added, in case anyone had missed his point. 'But as it happens, the remaining two crew members in D-Donald didn't attend the dance on Saturday. Flight Sergeant Briggs --- he's the mid upper-gunner --- had 48 hours' leave, and didn't return until Monday evening, and Corporal Dobson, the rear gunner, was in the Crown all evening, playing in a darts tournament. So I don't think we need interview either of them again.'
'Which brings us to the women,' said Strong, consulting his list. 'Those who were standing near enough to hear the quarrel, I mean... Let's see. Aircraftwoman Taylor seems to have had a lot to say for herself. We'll start with her.'
'Perhaps,' said Rowlands hesitantly. 'We should talk to Mr Pryce, too?'
'Indeed,' was the chief constable's reply. 'And I'll want to have Moncrieff in again. Ask him what he was playing at...'
'You can't think that had anything to do with Bly's death?' interjected Hawkins. 'Why, the two of them were friends...'
The fact remains,' replied Valentine tersely, 'that he wasn't quite straight with us. Why didn't he mention that he'd left the mess to see Pryce --- not once but on two separate occasions?'
'No doubt he thought it wasn't relevant,' replied  Hawkins, with some asperity. 'After all, the conversation or conversations he had with his flight engineer can hardly have had a bearing on what happened to young Bly.'
'You know as well as I do, Wing Commander Hawkins, that everything has a bearing on a case like this --- until it can be ruled out,' said the chief constable. 'But I take your point about Mr Moncrieff. Strong'll handle him with kid gloves --- won't you, Arthur? I know he's one of your best pilots.'
'He's due to fly another important mission in the next few days,' said Hawkins. 'I'd rather he wasn't upset, if it's all the same to you?'
'Reading you loud and clear,' said Valentine. 'Now, about these young ladies...'
Aircraftwoman Joyce Taylor bounced into the room with an energy suggestive of the hockey pitch, thought Rowlands. Yes, she remembered the events of Saturday night very well, she said. 'I'd just come off the dance floor. Dilys --- that's Aircraftwoman Saunders --- and I were going to get a drink. We were both feeling rather hot. That's when he came in...'
'I take it you're referring to Jan Wawrzkowicz?'
'That's right, Inspector. I was standing right next to Jonny --- Flying Officer Bly, I mean. He really let him have it!' She chuckled reminiscently. 
'Can you remember what was said?'
'Oh, yes.' Miss Taylor's version of this differed somewhat from that given by the three men. 'It was obvious he had a thing about Anne --- Aircraftwoman Rowlands, I mean. "You'd better make yourself scarce --- or I'll know that reason why," he said to the Polish chap. "Can't you see you're not wanted here?"'
'He said that, did he?' The inspector sounded faintly dubious. Miss Taylor was unabashed, however. 'As far as I can recall. Mind you, the band had started up again, so it was hard to hear exactly. It was pretty loud,' said the girl. 'Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree'. It's a favourite tune of mine.' 
Dilys Saunders had little more to add. Yes, she'd heard the row between Jonny Bly and the Polish boy, but to be honest, she hadn't paid much attention. Silly rows did tend to break out when the boys had had a few. I wasn't even standing very close,' she said. 'Bingo --- Flying Officer Callander --- had just asked me to dance, so I was, well, more interested in that, really.'
'But you heard something?'
'Only Jonny shouting to the other chap to clear off, and leave Anne alone... at least, I think that's what he said. And then the Polish boy saying, "You'll be sorry for those words"... or something to that effect.'
Now it was Anne's turn to be 'grilled', as the group captain had put it. Rowlands found that he was holding his breath, as his daughter came into the room and, at the inspector's invitation, sat down. He hoped against hope that she'd keep her temper, determining to say nothing during the interrogation unless it was absolutely called for. Let her fight her own battles. He'd do more harm than good by officiously defending her. 
The questions began innocuously enough. 'Thank you for joining us, Miss Rowlands,' said Strong pleasantly. 'I shan't keep you long. I've a few supplementary questions I'd like to ask you, concerning what took place last Saturday evening. You had arranged to meet Mr Wawrzkowicz at the dance, I believe?'
'That's right,' said Anne. 'As I told Group Captain Forrester, I arrived at the mess at around a quarter to eight.'
'Mr Wawrzkowicz had not yet arrived, I take it?'
'No. I wasn't expecting him until a bit later. He... he had further to come to get to the airfield than most of the others.'
'Quite so. But you were with friends, were you not?'
'Yes. Jean and I... that is Aircraftwoman Underhill and I, arrived together. Mary Thwaites joined us soon afterwards, She's in the pay corps. There were several others from my hut, too. Joyce Taylor was one.'
'We've already talked to Miss Taylor. So,' said the inspector, in the same avuncular tone he had used with all the women. 'You were enjoying yourself? You had no inkling of any ill feeling from any one member of the assembled company to another?'
'No, Inspector.'
'And this mood of, shall we say, good fellowship, continued even after the arrival of Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff and his friends?'
'It did. Rupert and his crowd always make more noise than the rest, but it all seemed pretty good-humoured. Or so I thought,' she added softly.
'So it wasn't until Mr Wawrzkowicz got there, at around a quarter past eight, that the mood changed --- am I right?'
'I suppose so. It wasn't Jan who started it, though.'
'We'll get to that. Can you tell me first exactly what was said by whom, and in what order?' Perhaps seeing her hesitate, he added kindly, 'I realise this must be rather an ordeal for you, Miss Rowlands --- and that you have already gone through most of this before, with the group captain. But it would be a great help to me to hear your account first-hand.'
'Of course,' said Anne. 'I was only trying to get my thoughts in order. I think,' she began cautiously, 'that it was Jonny... Flying Officer Bly... who spoke first. He said something like, "Oh Lord, look who's here?" when he saw Jan... Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz. I'd just spotted him --- Jan, I mean --- from across the room. I waved to attract his attention, because he didn't see me at first. It was as I was walking towards him --- towards the door, where he'd just come in, that I heard Jonny say "What the hell are you doing here? You've got a blasted nerve, I must say."' She was silent a moment. 'He was drunk. I don't think he knew what he was saying.'
'How did Mr Wawrzkowicz react?'
'Jan? He just shrugged and started to walk past Jonny... towards where I was standing. Only then Jonny grabbed his sleeve --- or tried to. "Where the hell do you think you're going?" he said --- or shouted, rather. "Take your hands off me," said Jan. "Or by God you'll regret it."
There was a silence after she said these words. 'It wasn't a threat,' she went on. 'He was just trying to shake him off --- Jonny, I mean.' It was what Trescott had said, too. It was just the Polish lad's way of shutting him up, sir. Rowlands wondered whether the police would buy it. Then Strong said something which made him jump, coming as it did after a series of unexceptional questions. 'So if it wasn't a threat, then how do you account for the fact that somebody --- whether it was Mr Wawrzkowicz or another --- shot Mr Bly dead a matter of hours later? The quarrel was heard by a number of witnesses, Miss Rowlands --- all of whom, apart from yourself, supposed that it was this that led directly to Jonathan Bly's murder. You see, do you not, how such a supposition might come about?'
'I do,' was the reply. 'And yet I don't believe it for a moment. Mr Wawrzkowicz is a patriot and a... a decent human being. The idea that he could shoot down an unarmed man in cold blood... It's ... it's preposterous!'
'It seems a pity then,' replied the policeman gravely, 'that he chose to run away, instead of staying to prove his innocence.'
'I expect,' said Anne defiantly, 'he thought he'd stand a better chance of doing that outside prison.'
'I hope you're not implying that Mr Wawrzkowicz wouldn't have received fair treatment from the police?' said the chief constable. 'I can only assume he thought he wouldn't,' she replied. 'Because of being a foreigner.'
'Aircraftwoman Rowlands, I really think you should watch your tone.' Group Captain Forrester, who hath hitherto remained silent, now sounded a warning note. Anne paid no attention to this. 'Oh, I know you'll say that the police will handle this case without fear or favour,' she said. 'But I'm afraid that's academic, as far as Jan's concerned. While he has great respect for our British institutions, he's experienced enough anti-Polish feeling since he arrived here six months ago not to trust entirely in the authorities.'
Once more, Rowlands --- while deprecating her outspokenness --- couldn't help being impressed by the quiet conviction with which his daughter spoke. This was no infatuated schoolgirl, but a serious young woman, who had made up her own mind about the situation and wasn't to be persuaded otherwise. The chief constable appeared to be of the same mind, for he said, 'All right. Let's assume for a moment that Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz didn't do what he's accused of doing. Who, then, in your opinion, killed Jonathan Bly?'
Anne thought for a moment. 'I don't know,' she said at last. 'But I do know that Jonny was worried about something, in the days leading up to his death. Something more than the things they all worry about,' she added. 'Such as getting shot down, or... or being found out as a coward.'
'What gave you that impression?' asked the chief constable. 'That Flying Officer Bly was worried, I mean.'
'It was something he said,' was the reply. 'I didn't think anything of it, at the time, but later I wondered... We were having a drink in the King's Head,' she went on. 'It must have been last week Thursday. I'd just gone off duty and I was waiting for Jean and Mary to arrive, when Jonny came in. He was by himself, which was unusual in itself, because he was always with a crowd...'
'Mr Moncrieff and his friends?'
'Yes. But on this occasion, he was alone. He'd just come from running some checks on his machine, D-Donald, he said. He'd wanted a word with the flight engineer about something that was affecting the reception on his radio-telephone --- Jonny was the navigator, you know. Anyway, he'd been to see Mr Pryce --- he's the flight engineer --- and something about the meeting had bothered him. 'There's some very funny business going on at Mildenhall," he said. 'And I don't mean funny ha ha." I tried to jolly him along a bit... Jonny and I were quite good friends, in spite of... well, everything... and I thought he was just suffering from an attack of the blues. All the men get them --- it's hardly surprising, when you think what they go through... Anyway, I said something like, "Cheer up! It can't be that bad, surely?" It was what he said next that stayed with me,' said Anne, a certain horror in her voice. 'He said, "It's much worse than that, I'm telling you. These people will stop at nothing..."'
'What do you think he meant by that?' said Valentine softly.
'I didn't get a chance to ask him. At that moment, Rupert Moncrieff and his crowd came in, and there was the usual rowdy back-chat. Jonny joined them, and then Jean came in, and we got talking, and I forgot all about it. Until now,' she said. 'If it hadn't been for what happened afterwards, I'd have thought nothing of it.'
'Well,' said Valentine, when Anne had gone out. 'I wonder what was eating young Bly? Sounds as if it was rather more than the usual matters that weigh on a young man's mind. Girl trouble and so on...'
'It sounds like a lot of nonsense to me,' said Forrester. 'These young fellers get notions. I don't imagine there's anything in what he said. Just nervous strain.'

### Chapter Six ###

There was a pause while all those present --- Rowlands, Group Captain Forrester, the wing commander, the chief constable and the inspector --- lit cigarettes, and considered the evidence so far. Again, came a whiff of that pleasant, but unusual, Bacon Bros of Cambridge mixture. Rowlands thought idly that if he hadn't already been a Churchman's smoker, he'd have liked to try a similar mixture. Wasn't there a tobacconist in St James's that did them? 
'All right,' said the group captain, interrupting this reverie. 'Let's get on, shall we? We haven't got all day.' 
Rowlands, sensing that his presence there was under sufferance, went first:
'Who found the body?'
'It was one of the men,' replied Forrester. 'Flight Sergeant Tomkins. He's with F-Freddie's crew. Mid-upper gunner. Good man.'
'Was he at the dance, too?'
'Not he. Playing in a darts match...'
'The same team as Corporal Dobson's, presumably?'
'That's the one,' said the group captain. 'You've a good memory, I'll say that for you, Mr Rowlands.' Rowlands smiled, but didn't say that training his memory had been essential to survival, in the years since he'd become blind. The sighted had less need of such a resource. For them, the world was largely apprehended through immediate impressions, without the constant need to test these against previous experience that being blind necessitated. 'We'd better have him in, I suppose,' said Forrester. 'Although as you'll see, his statement is fairly straightforward. Not a lot for you to pick over, Ronnie.'
'I'll be the judge of that,' said the chief constable, in a humorous tone. 'Ask him to come in, will you, Hawkins?'
Flight Sergeant Eric Tomkins turned out to be a Londoner --- born and bred in Camberwell, he said. 'I'm from that part of London myself,' said Rowlands. 'I was married in St Giles's Church.' Briefly, his thoughts flitted back to that time. It had still been wartime, and so Edith had decided against being married from her parents' home, in favour of remaining in London. Helen and Harold Edwards had travelled up from Poole to be present at the ceremony, which has also been attended by Ralph, Edith's brother, and by Rowlands' sister, Dorothy. Jack Ashenhurst had been Best Man. Funny how things turned out...  
'So, Flight Sergeant, just to recap. You were at the Crown public house from around eight p.m. until a little after eleven, am I right?' The precise, rather expressionless tones of the inspector's voice bought Rowlands back to the here-and-now with a start. 'Yes, sir.' Having left the Crown with his two companions at closing time, Tomkins said that it had taken him and his mates perhaps ten minutes to walk back to the airfield. 'But you were alone when you found Mr Bly's body?'
'I was, sir. Ginger... I mean, Corporal Dobson... and Patsy Patterson... that's Flying Officer Patterson... had gone on ahead, like.' With some embarrassment, he admitted that he'd been taken short. 'I... I'd just gone behind the hangar to... to relieve myself, when... when I saw 'im, lying there.' He shuddered. 'Horrible, it was. Fair turned me up.'
'What time was this, exactly?' asked Strong. 'Think it must've been about a quarter past eleven, sir --- give or take a couple of minutes,' replied the other. 'Didn't see 'im --- Mr Bly --- at first, because it was dark, like. It was only when I took a step back that I... well, I nearly fell over 'im, sir. Horrible.'
'Yes, yes,' said Forrester with faint impatience. 'It can't have been pleasant. But you need to pull yourself together, man.'
'Sir.'
'If I might ask a question?' said Rowlands. Given the go-ahead by the chief constable, he went on, 'Were you aware of anyone else in the vicinity, Flight Sergeant?'
'Come again, sir?'
'Did you see anyone else nearby?'
'Not that I remember, sir.' Again, Tomkins suppressed a shudder. 'You don't think that he... the one that did it... was still lurking about?'
'Impossible to say. I don't suppose you heard anything?' persisted Rowlands. He was thinking of the shot; but Tomkins' thoughts were still with the lurker. 'You mean, like breathing?' he said. 'Somebody hanging about, like? No sir, can't say as I did.'
'So once you'd, er, stumbled over Mr Bly's body, you raised the alarm, I gather?' said Strong, consulting his notes. 'I did, sir. Flight Lieutenant Avery and Flying Officer Ferris were the duty officers. They took charge.'
'And the Medical Officer established that life was extinct at 11.43,' said the policeman. 'Thank you, Mr Tomkins, I think that will be all.'
 'So that gives us an approximate time of death,' said Valentine, after Tomkins had left the room. 'Between eleven pm, when Bly was seen leaving the dance, and a quarter-past eleven, when his body was found--- which accords with the MO's findings, does it not?'
'Yes. He reckoned Bly had been dead under an hour,' said the group captain. 'Something to do with rigor mortis having passed off...'
'Wawrzkowicz must have lain in wait for him,' said Hawkins, with sudden venom. 'Beastly low trick to pull on an unarmed man.'
    
At the group captain's suggestion, the interrogation team walked across to Hangar 1, to 'beard Wally Pryce in his den', as Forrester put it. 'He and the rest of the ground crew'll be occupied for the next few hours getting the machines ready for tonight's mission,' he added. 'The less time we keep him from his duties the better, in my opinion.'
It was the first time that Rowlands had visited this part of the airfield, and he was conscious, as he walked, accompanied as ever by the faithful Rex, of an atmosphere of heightened tension, and of the visceral throb of powerful engines being tested at the dispersal area, which lay some distance away, beyond the row of hangars, he judged. Even so, the sound was loud enough --- starting as a low rumble, and swelling at last to a roar that seemed to split the air, making the eardrums throb. It struck him in the same moment that the dog might find the noise unsettling, and he murmured words of reassurance; but Rex, it seemed, was unperturbed. Evidently his years in Brighton, with all its heavy military traffic, had inured him to the present din.
As Rowlands and his companions reached the hangars, groups of men --- ground crew, he surmised --- hurried to and fro, shouting orders full of technical terms, to do with bomb-loads, air speeds, and fuel capacity, which meant little to him, but which evidently conveyed a great deal to the initiated. Even the usually dry and laconic Forrester seemed affected by the excitement. 'Beautiful machines, these,' he said, shouting to be heard above the engines' drone. 'Each has four twelve-cylinder Rolls Royce Merlin engines, driving four three-bladed propellors. They've a wingspan of 102 feet and a top speed of 280 miles per hour. They can eat up 2,500 miles without the smallest difficulty. We've got twenty of the beauties on site at the moment, with another twenty to arrive from Avro next month. You mark my words, Mr Rowlands. It's these that'll win us the war.'
'Impressive,' said Rowlands, whose impression of what the 'Lancs' looked like was partial, to say the least. The last generation of aeroplanes with which he'd anything to do had been the racing models of the early thirties --- the Tiger Moths, Avians, Bluebirds, and Martlets of those glamorous, far-off days --- and even then, his actual flying experience had been minimal. A single jaunt in a Gypsy Moth as the passenger of a flying ace had been the extent of it --- yet this had left an indelible impression on his mind. Even now, over ten years on, he recalled the disconcerting sensation of leaving one's stomach behind, as the plane became airborne, and the extraordinary silence that fell, as one ascended above the clouds...
It would be a very different story for the young pilots of these great war machines, he thought, as, with the other men leading the way, he entered the big hangar. For them, there could be no carefree joy-riding. Their planes could reach racing speeds, it was true, but they were not designed for racing, as those pre-war models had been. Their purpose was not to break records and thrill crowds with displays of aeronautic skill, but to bring death and destruction. 'Mind how you go,' said Forrester, steering him past one of the 'beauties'. 'You don't want to walk into the wheel.'
Rowlands agreed that he certainly didn't. At the group captains's say-so, he came to a halt beside the great steel bird, which reared (so said Forrester) twenty feet above their heads. 'Each of these planes is sixty-nine feet long,' the latter informed his guests proudly. 'With a fuselage consisting of metal plates, held together with rivets... I've no idea how many. Pryce could probably tell you... Ah, there you are, Aircraftman Pryce! I was just telling these gentlemen that you're the man to ask when it comes to the technical stuff.'
'Right enough, sir.' Pryce's soft Welsh lilt could only just be heard over the general cacophony of hammering, drilling and sawing that filled the great echoing vault in which the four of them stood. 'So what can I do for you, Group Captain? Only I'm rather busy just now, getting T-Tommy overhauled in time for tonight. Blocked fuel-pipe.'
'Yes, yes,' said Forrester hastily. 'We won't keep you long. The inspector here has a few questions...'
 'The fact is,' went on Pryce, as if he hadn't heard. 'It's against the regulations, see? No civilians allowed in the workshop area. Nor dogs, neither,' he added, on seeing Rex. 'We can't have them running all over the shop and getting underfoot.' At this suggestion that his behaviour might be anything but impeccable, the animal emitted a low growl. 
'I know all that,' said Forrester in a placatory tone. 'But I said it would be all right. Now then, Pryce, as I said, Inspector Strong has a few questions for you. He's making some enquires into what happened after the dance on Saturday night...'
'I wasn't at the dance,' said the Welshman stubbornly. 'I went for drink with Spinks here --- isn't that right, Spinksie?'
'Aye, I reckon so,' said a man with a Yorkshire accent. 'It were Saturday night.' 
'That's as maybe,' said Strong, evidently feeling it was time he intervened. 'But you were here at Mildenhall for at least some of that night, were you not, Mr Pryce?'
'Might've been,' was the guarded reply. 'What of it?'
'You were heard talking to Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff at around nine p.m. The witness says you and Moncrieff were having a disagreement. I want to know what it was about.'
Pryce was silent a moment. 'I don't know what you mean,' he said at last. '"Disagreement", is it? I don't remember nothing like that. Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff might've been sounding off a little about the state of his machine --- he's very particular, is the Flight Lieutenant --- but I wouldn't have said it was a disagreement, as such.'
'Then what do you think he --- Moncrieff --- meant when he said, "It's got to stop, do you hear?"' persisted the inspector. 'The witness was quite clear that that was what was said.'
'I haven't the least idea,' was the reply. 'If Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff said that... and I don't recall exactly what was said... then it must have been to do with the machine. Like I said, he's very particular about his machine, is the Flight Lieutenant. Likely there was something I'd done, or hadn't done, that he wasn't happy about.' 
There was evidently not much more to be got out of the technician, if his memory continued to be so unreliable. Nor was Forrester keen to prolong the informal interrogation --- conveying, by the slight impatience of his manner, that Pryce had more important things to do than answer a lot of footling questions. 'When he's finished with the checks on that plane, it'll need to be bombed-up,' he said. 'We're already behind schedule, as it is. I don't want any further delays.'  
The group captain was similarly reluctant to haul in Moncrieff for a third interview --- given that the latter was scheduled to lead a sortie that night, if the weather remained fair. 'I'd as soon avoid unsettling the man just before an important operation,' he said. 'When he and his crew are safe back from Ops, then you can grill him to your heart's content, Ronnie.'
'All right, you've made your point,' replied the other. 'I won't upset your young hero unless I have to. As it happens, we've enough to be getting on with, tracking down our Polish fugitive --- haven't we, Strong? I don't suppose,' he added slyly, 'you have any idea where he might have gone to earth, Mr Rowlands?' 
'I'm afraid not,' said Rowlands. He didn't mention his intuition that Wawrzkowicz must still be somewhere in the area. Since he hadn't been picked up at any of the railway stations or airfields in the vicinity, and there had been no reports, as far as he knew, that the Pole had been sighted at any of the nearby ports, Rowlands concluded that the man was lying low in some spot not too far from Station 43. The police could work that out for themselves, of course. But he didn't see why he should make it any easier for them.

Walking back to the village with Rex, an hour or so later, it seemed to Rowlands that little of any value had been learned from the police interrogations at which he'd been present that day, and which had only been concluded to allow those service personnel concerned to resume their duties. Even a murder investigation, it seemed, took second place to the demands of attending the afternoon's briefing, and (for those slated to fly) of preparing for the night's mission. The quarrel between Bly and Wawrzkowicz, and who exactly had threatened whom, appeared to have been at the heart of the matter, he thought --- and yet on the face of it, the thing was absurd. Two young men fighting over a girl. It hardly seemed a reason for one of them to turn a gun on the other...
Still puzzling over all this, he entered the pub, which seemed, for once, deserted. No doubt the fact that the crowd of young men in airforce blue who would otherwise have been downing pints were at that very moment getting ready to take off for the 'Big City' and other, no less dangerous, destinations, accounted for this. As he stood at the bar, Rowlands fancied he could hear the distant drone of a squadron of Lancs passing overheard. He sent up a silent prayer that they and their crews would return safely.
Thinking himself the only customer, he was anticipating a chat over a pint with the pub's affable landlord, who --- when he wasn't busy --- liked to avail himself of the chance for some 'sensible talk' (as he put it) with a man of his own generation. 'These young fellers think they know it all,' he'd said, during a previous quiet spell. 'Just a'cause they know their way around one o' them monstrous machines. But when you've lived as long as we have, Mr Rowlands, sir, you know there's more to life than flying aeroplanes.' With which piece of homespun philosophy Rowlands could only concur.
Now, as he stood waiting to order --- beer for him, and a bowl of water for Rex --- he prepared himself for more of the same. But Catchpole's first remark was not about the deplorable state of the world outside the four walls of his pub, but concerned a matter closer to home. 'Thought as I'd let him be,' he said in an undertone to Rowlands, as he drew the requested pint. 'Out like a light, he was...' And, now that his attention had been drawn to this, Rowlands realised that they were not alone. Gentle snores came from across the room, indicating that somebody had found the combination of beer and the warmth of the fire overwhelming. 'Had a bit too much, silly lad --- not that it was me that served him! Must've been that new feller at the Crown. Half-cut when he came in. Sleeping it off he is, now. He won't bother you none, sir. Just thought as I should let you know...'
The landlord had spoken quietly, but the sound must have been enough to disturb the sleeper, for there came a muffled exclamation from the chimney corner, followed by the scraping of a chair on the floor. Unsteady footsteps came towards them. 'Gi' me a whisky,' said a voice, slurred by drink. 'An' make it snappy.'
'Now then, sir, I don't think you want any more, do you?' said the landlord in a soothing tone, eliciting a truculent reply. 'I bloody do! Need it, don't I? After what I've been through...'
'Do yourself a favour,' intervened Rowlands. 'Go back to barracks and get your head down. You'll feel better in the morning.'
But the suggestion met with no more favour with the young airman than the landlord's refusal to serve him. 'Who asked you?' he demanded belligerently, eliciting a growl from Rex, who always took exception to any rudeness towards his master. 'Telling you, I need a drink. Help me sleep...' 
'Come now, sir. It's time you went home.'
The young man ignored this, seemingly lost in his own misery. 'You civilians don't know what it's like... Up there. Night after night in the freezing cold. Being shot at... and seeing your friends being shot and killed. Last week my rear gunner copped it. Poor bloody Tail End Charlie. Had to scrape what was left of him off the Perspex. Poor little blighter. Shot to pieces he was. The kite, too. All but one of the engines failed, Made it home... just.' He let out a belch. 'Oops. Sorry. No, you people don't understand...'
Silently, the landlord took a bottle from under the counter and poured a measure into a glass. He slid this across to the pilot. 'That's your lot,' he said. 'And then be off with you, back to barracks, like the gentleman says. You'll do no good brooding about what's past.'
When the lad had finished his drink, and stumbled out, breathing whisky fumes, Catchpole said apologetically, 'I know I shouldn't have let him have another. But I've seen that look he had before --- it takes some of 'em that way. As if they've done with life.'
Rowlands, who had seen the same look in the eyes of some of the men he'd been with in France in 1917, said nothing. There was nothing to say.     
Into the silence, came the ringing of the telephone.
'Now, who can that be?' said Catchpole. He went to answer it, returning after a moment. 'It's for you, Mr Rowlands, sir. Didn't give a name. Sounded foreign.'
Rowlands thanked him, and went out into the passage where the telephone was. 'Hello? Frederick Rowlands speaking. Who is this?'
There was a brief silence, then a voice with a strong Polish accent said, 'You are father of Miss Anne, yes? I have message for her. Tell her Jan says not to worry. He is safe, tell her.'
'I assume you must be a friend of Mr Wawrzkowicz's?'
'A friend, yes.'
'Is he there with you?'
The other laughed. 'If he were, I would not tell you. Now I must go.'
'Wait. Can you give him a message from me? Tell him he should give himself up to the police. I'll see that he's treated fairly...'
But the other had already hung up.
Cursing himself for having scared the man off, Rowlands returned to finish his drink. There followed an hour's desultory chat with the landlord, in which neither referred to the telephone call with the mysterious foreigner. After a bite of supper, he took himself off to bed, intending an early start next day. There seemed little point in prolonging his visit to Suffolk. As he prepared himself for sleep, he thought over what he'd actually learned, in the course of the past two days, and had to admit it wasn't much. There was the question mark over what had happened in the hours before Jonny Bly was killed --- notably Moncrieff's row with his ground engineer, and what it had meant. There was what Anne had said about her meeting in the pub with Bly a few days before, and what the young man had said about there being 'some funny business' going on at Mildenhall. Was it enough to shift suspicion from Wawrzkowicz to another person ---  call him 'X' --- especially given that there wasn't the slightest indication who that person might be?
Over bacon and eggs the next morning, he deliberated as to how best to convey Wawrzkowicz's message to Anne, without drawing attention to the fact that he'd been in contact --- albeit indirectly ---with the Polish fugitive.  He'd already decided not to mention last night's telephone call to the police. The fact that it had been he to whom the message had been relayed told him all he needed to know about Wawrzkowicz's continuing wariness of the authorities. But how to get the message to his daughter without arousing suspicion? That was the question.
He was still pondering how best to do this as he and Rex (both now fortified by an ample breakfast) approached the airfield. Perhaps he could leave a --- suitably vague --- note with the sentry? He knew there was little chance of getting to speak to Anne herself, who was doubtless being kept busy by her superiors, after a day of neglecting her duties. Then, as he drew near to the gate, he heard the sound of a vehicle approaching from behind. It pulled up in front of the gatehouse. 'Car for Group Captain Forrester,' called the driver --- a young woman --- having wound down the window. 'Right you are, Miss Underhill,' came the reply. 'I'll just telephone through to say you're on your way.'
'Hi there! Wait a moment, can't you?' cried Rowlands, quickening his pace, until he had drawn level with the car, which stood with its engine idling, awaiting the signal to proceed. 'Miss Underhill. You don't know me, but you know my daughter, Anne Rowlands, I believe?' 
'Yes, I know Anne.'
'Could you give her a message from me? Tell her to ring me at home this evening, would you? Only I'm returning to Brighton this morning and won't have a chance to see her.'
'Right-ho,' was the cheerful reply. 'Any particular time?'
'If you could tell her after six,' said Rowlands, thinking that he should at least make an effort to turn up at the office that afternoon. Mavis Bates had been a great help, but he couldn't expect her to hold the fort for longer than two days. 'Wilco,' said the aircraftwoman; then, as Rowlands was turning away: 'I say, you're the detective, aren't you?'
'Well... in a manner of speaking.'
'Anne's told us all about you,' said the girl. 'Says you always get your man. Hope you do so this time. We can't have murderers at Mildenhall.'

Then for the next few days, nothing much happened. Rowlands, now back in Brighton, got on with the day to day tasks of running the After-Care Unit, and with completing the move to the new office. Notwithstanding the combined efforts of Mavis Bates and John Harvey, there were still a lot of boxes to unpack and files to return to filing cabinets, as well as arguments to be had with the GPO about redirecting the post, and installing a new line, which would, Rowlands knew, continue well into the following week. 'Don't you know there's a war on?' was the now familiar response to any attempt to hurry this process along --- to which Rowlands could only reply that, yes, he knew it all too well.
With regard to what he thought of as 'the Mildenhall affair', there was little progress, either. As arranged through Jean Underhill, he'd passed the message from Wawrzkowicz to Anne on the night of his return home. 'At least you know he's all right,' he said. 'That's something.' She agreed that it was. 'Who was it you spoke to?' she asked; but Rowlands didn't know. 'My guess is that it was Captain Czarnecki --- the one we didn't manage to speak to that day at Station 43.' It seemed obvious that it had to be one of Wawrzkowicz's particular group of comrades who'd been the one to get in touch. That was how things worked in the army, or airforce --- or whatever branch of the services one was in. You looked out for your mates. He thought of the tight little circle of friends around Rupert Moncrieff. It was the same story there. 
He'd ended the call by getting Anne to promise to let him know of any further developments. 'You know how your mother worries,' he said --- and it was true that Edith had been upset when she heard what had happened. 'I knew it would come to no good,' she said. 'Fraternising with... well, foreigners. For all we know, this man has a criminal past.'
'For all we know, he doesn't,' her husband said firmly. Although he, too, couldn't help wishing he'd never heard of Jan Wawrzkowicz.
The weather remained bitterly cold, with freezing fog to add to the icy conditions, and no sign of a thaw. Even with a fire going, it was so cold in the office that Rowlands told his secretary to follow his example and keep her coat on. By four o'clock it was dark and --- although it made little difference to him --- he sent her home early. He wondered, as he and Rex made their cautious way back to Dorset Gardens, along pavements slippery with compacted snow, what it must be like for a man hiding out in the open. In almost two weeks, there had been no news of Wawrzkowicz. It seemed as if he had vanished from the face of the earth.
The phone was ringing as he got in; he snatched it up. 'Yes?'
'Daddy, it's me.' Anne, of course. He held his breath, fearing the worst. 'They've found Jan's motorbike.' He breathed again. Although with this news, the worst had only receded somewhat. The owner of the motorbike was still missing. 'Where was it found?'
'Wicken Fen. It's a kind of nature reserve, about half an hour's drive from here.' She was phoning from Mildenhall, he guessed. 'No houses around for miles. The bike was hidden under a hedge near the keeper's cottage. When the snow began to thaw, it was uncovered...'
'By the keeper himself, presumably?'
'Yes. Oh Daddy, you'll come, won't you? There's going to be a manhunt. With dogs. Jan doesn't stand a chance.' Rowlands thought that, given how successfully the young man had evaded the authorities so far, this wasn't a foregone conclusion. But he said, 'I'll be there --- and I'll be bringing my own dog. We've as good a chance of finding your friend as anyone else, don't you think?


### Chapter Seven ###

Wicken Fen was a desolate place in the dead of winter --- a flat expanse of water and reed-beds, surrounded by woods, and with two lonely cottages the only human habitation --- one of them belonging to the keeper who had found the motorbike. 'It's been a nature reserve since the turn of the century,' Anne said as she and her father, accompanied by the dog, set out along the snow-covered track that led into the heart of the fen. 'It was set up partly as a bird sanctuary, and partly to preserve some of the old ways of life here --- before the fens were drained, in the seventeenth century. People made a living catching eels, and cutting the sedge for thatch.'
'Ah,' said her father. 'There were still remnants of the old ways when I was a boy, in Norfolk... but go on. You seem to know a lot about the area, considering you've only been stationed here a few months.'
'It was Jan who told me about it,' said Anne. 'He's interested in the history of places like this. We came here, once or twice. He liked the quiet. It's why I wasn't surprised when I heard his motorbike had been found here.' They'd already talked to the keeper who'd found the machine: 'Knew at once it didn't belong to no one local,' he said. 'Military model, I'd say. Not the sort o' thing you'd expect to find stuck away in a hedge, like.'
The keeper's cottage lay at the end of a lane leading from the village. They'd got a lift as far as the turning in a staff car, driven by Jean Underhill. 'I hope the Hellcat doesn't find out that I've been using a government vehicle for unorthodox purposes, or there'll be no end of a stink,' said the aircraftwoman cheerfully. 'Luckily I had a delivery to make out this way. I'd offer to pick you up,' she added. 'But I've no idea what time you'll want collecting.'
'It's all right,' said Anne. 'We'll manage. Thanks awfully, Jean. You're a brick.'
'Don't mention it,' was the reply, and the car moved off, leaving their unofficial search party to make its way as best it could. It was still only eleven o'clock in the morning, so --- by Rowlands' reckoning --- they had about five hours of daylight ahead of them. Not that it mattered to him whether it was dark or light, but his companion would need all the help she could get, if she were to pilot them both through this wilderness. At least they had Rex as an extra pair of eyes and ears --- and nose, thought Rowlands. It was still bitterly cold, and looked set to freeze again tonight. As the sun began to go down, at around half past three, it would get colder still.
Their footsteps crunched on the frosty grass of the track --- it was called a 'drove', Anne said --- disturbing a water bird, which flew up from the reed-bed with a clatter of wings. 'Stay,' murmured Rowlands to Rex, who had shown signs of taking an interest in this denizen of the watery world. 'You're only supposed to bring back the killed fowl.' He thought how much he'd have relished being out in this landscape when he was a boy, with frogs and eels to catch, and wildfowl to shoot (not that he'd owned a gun in those far-off days). But that time was over and done --- as it was for the people who had worked this land, over the centuries. Now, all that was left of that land, and its ancient way of life, was this remnant of a few hundred acres --- and even some of that, Anne said, had been requisitioned for food production by the War Office, as part of its Dig for Victory campaign.
'So where are we heading?' asked Rowlands, when they had been trudging along for a while. 'I'm not sure, exactly,' was the reply. 'That's why I wanted Rex along. If Jan's here, he'll find him, won't you, boy?'
'But...' her father started to say, when she touched his arm. 'Not that way,' she said softly. Because from up ahead came the sound of voices, and of dogs barking. It must be the search party from the airfield, Rowlands realised, wondering in the same moment what chance he and Anne stood against this far larger and no doubt better organised operation. This place must stretch for miles. They could walk all day and find nothing.
Then Anne said, 'I've got a handkerchief that belonged to Jan. He lent it to me a while ago, and I... I forgot to give it back.' Still holding him by the arm, she drew Rowlands off the main drove and into a narrower track that ran between reed-beds. 'I recognise this spot, now,' she said. 'It looked different in summer --- but there's the wind-pump, and the little bridge. Up ahead's the mere. It's half frozen over at the moment. If we continue along this path, it'll bring us to a wood. In the middle of that's a clearing with some disused brick kilns. If Jan's here, that's where he'll have taken shelter.'
'All right,' said Rowlands. 'You'd better lead on.' To his relief, the sounds of the Mildenhall search party had faded into the distance. He'd no wish to confront whoever was in charge of this, as they and their men quartered the ground for signs that the fugitive had been there. He and Anne had left the path by now, and were making their way, not without difficulty, through the mass of tangled briars and scrubby bushes at the entrance to the wood. Here, the sounds from outside were muffled by the screen of trees, as were their footsteps by the thick layer of mud and frozen leaves that covered the ground. They walked for a while longer, and then Anne stopped. 'I think we're getting near,' she said. She bent down and gave Rex the handkerchief to sniff. 'Find him, Rex. Find Jan.'
For a moment the dog stood still, as if tuning in to this new test of his tracking skills. Then, with a gruff bark, he dived off into the undergrowth. Anne set off in pursuit, with Rowlands following as best he could. 'I say, slow down!' he cried, afraid that, without either Anne or the dog to guide him, he might end up in a ditch or worse, plunge headlong into the frozen mere. 'It's this way, Daddy. Oh, do be quick!' He accordingly quickened his pace, and as he drew level with her, she took his arm once more. 'I think he's found something,' she said, meaning Rex, who'd clearly picked up a scent. Rowlands hoped that it wasn't just that of a fox or a rabbit. 'Steady on,' he said. 'If Rex really has found something, it might be best not to draw attention to the fact.' Because his sharp hearing had again picked up the sound of barking dogs --- still distant, but drawing nearer. 'He's taking us to the old brick kiln,' said Anne, paying no attention to this warning. 'I said it was where Jan would go.'
When they reached the place, it was obvious that someone had been there, and recently. Within the half-ruined brick structure, were signs that a small fire had been lit, and carefully extinguished. A few empty tin cans, that had once contained soup or corned beef, had been neatly stacked by the side of this. But of the man who had lit the fire, and consumed the contents of the cans, there was no sign. 'He can't be far away,' said Anne. 'This shows he was here, not long ago...'
'If it was him, and not a tramp taking shelter.'
'Of course it was him,' said Anne impatiently. 'Rex picked up his scent from the handkerchief. Come on. We've got to find him before the others do.'
'Anne. Wait.' He knew she wouldn't want to hear what he said next, but felt it had to be said --- for her own sake, as well as that of the man they were seeking. 'Suppose he doesn't want to be found? Have you thought of that? After all,' he added gently, 'he's gone to a lot of trouble to cover his tracks.'
'Yes, but he said... he said I wasn't to worry --- that he was all right. Why send me that message, if he wanted no more to do with me?'
'That wasn't what I meant.'
But Anne was no longer paying attention. 'Listen!' she cried. 'It's Rex. He's found something.'
Because having led them to Jan Wawrzkowicz's hideout (if that was what it was) the animal had now, apparently, discovered some fresh evidence. A series of short, excited barks announced this. 'He's over by the mere,' said Anne, sounding no less excited. She seized her father's arm once more. 'This way. Careful! It's very icy underfoot.' For as they left the shelter of the trees, and followed the path towards the wide expanse of water, they found themselves again in the teeth of the wind. The dog was barking more urgently now. Rowlands felt a stirring of alarm. In the same moment, Anne let go of his arm and ran to where the dog stood guard over what it had found. Her scream raised the hairs on the back of Rowlands' neck. 'Oh God! Oh no! No, no...'
Then he, too ran forward, and found himself up to the ankles in freezing water, which had seeped up from beneath the layer of ice at the edge of the lake. As he stepped back, with an exclamation of dismay, he stumbled over the thing that lay there, half in and half out of the water. It felt like a bundle of waterlogged clothes... except that, as he found on further investigation, there was a body inside the clothes. Whoever it was had been dead for some time, evidently, since the corpse was as stiff and cold as the crystals of ice that had formed around it. If this was Jan Wawrzkowicz, then his flight from the authorities had come to a terrible end. 
Anne's cries had subsided into a quiet sobbing. 'Oh God...' she stammered brokenly. 'We m-must... we must do something... We c-can't leave him lying here...'
'Nor will we,' said her father. 'Get back. I'll deal with this.' Having tried and failed to lift the dead weight of the body by the arms, he resorted to the inelegant but more effective method of getting hold of the legs and dragging the partly submerged cadaver onto dry land. 'Get back!' he said once more, as with a final heave, he succeeded in this endeavour. 'Keep hold of Rex.' Because the dog's barking had grown increasingly frantic, as his master struggled with the unwieldy burden. Not that Rex was the problem, Rowlands thought grimly. It was his daughter he was worried about. She shouldn't have to see this.
But then, to Rowlands' astonishment, Anne's breathless sobbing ceased. 'Turn him over,' she cried. 'I'll help you.' Before he could stop her, she seized hold of one of the dead man's arms, in order to drag the body --- which had been lying face down --- onto its back. 'It's not him!' she cried, as this was accomplished. 'It's not Jan, after all.' 
'No, indeed,' said voice from behind them. It was Wing Commander Hawkins, who --- no doubt alerted by the sound of their voices --- had crept up unobserved, while Rowlands and his daughter had been occupied with their grisly discovery. 'I think you'll find that that's Walter Pryce, our ground engineer. He's been missing for the past few days.' Before Rowlands could respond to this startling piece of information, there came a fresh outburst of barking from Rex, who seemed to have taken the other man's arrival amiss. 'Control that animal, won't you?' Hawkins sounded on edge --- and no wonder, thought Rowlands. The discovery of yet another dead body connected to the RAF airbase was hardly likely to lighten the mood of one of the airbase's senior officers. 'I won't ask what you're doing here, Mr Rowlands --- although I can guess. Perhaps now you'll see how misguided you've been in trying to interfere in a military matter?'
'My concern is to see justice done, that's all,' said Rowlands. The other ignored this. 'As for you Aircraftwoman,' he said to Anne. 'I'm going to have to report this latest escapade of yours to your section leader.'
'I had her permission to meet my father, sir,' replied Anne evenly. 'Perhaps so,' snapped Hawkins. 'But not to go disturbing the scene of a crime.'
'I didn't...' she began to protest, but the wing commander paid no attention. 'Oh, I think you did,' he said. 'Against my express orders, you and your father have blundered all over a murder scene --- disturbing the corpse and obliterating evidence...'
'I was the one who moved the body,' put in Rowlands. 'My daughter had nothing to do with it.'
'And yet she brought you here. Almost,' said Hawkins, 'as if she knew what she would find.'
'That's not true!' cried Anne. In her agitation, she must have let go of the dog, for he flew at Hawkins, growling furiously. 'I said keep hold of that animal!' shouted the officer. 'Haven't you both done enough harm as it is?' 
But something the other had said struck Rowlands particularly. 'You said "murder scene", Wing Commander Hawkins,' he said. 'How can you be so sure that that is what this is? All the indications are that the man --- Pryce --- drowned. We don't know that it wasn't an accident.'
Hawkins gave a short laugh. 'You won't mind my saying, Mr Rowlands, that you are hardly in a position to judge. I think if you were able to see Walter Pryce's body, you would be left in no doubt that this was indeed murder. It's possible he drowned, of course. Although it's more likely that his death was brought about by the ligature around his neck. A primitive garrotte,' he added. 'A method of killing much favoured by the Polish resistance, I believe. Oh yes,' he went on, ignoring Anne's gasp of dismay. 'I don't think we'll have far to seek for the man who did this --- a man who has already killed at least once before. Looking at the way it was done, I'd say there was little doubt that your Mr Wawrzkowicz has added another murder to his tally.'
'I don't believe it!' But Anne's impassioned words were drowned out by the baying of bloodhounds, as other members of the search party burst upon them. 'Sir,' cried the first man. 'We've found him, sir. Or at least, signs that he's been here, and not long ago... Oh, lor'...' Because he must have caught sight of the sodden corpse, sprawled upon the ground. 'Gor' blimey, sir. Is that 'im, sir? The man we've been looking for?' 
'Does it look like it, Sergeant?' was the reply. 'I should have thought even you could tell the difference between a Polish uniform and one of our own.'
'Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.'
Hawkins sighed. 'I suppose we'd better get him out of here. Since there's little point in calling the police to the scene, now that it's been so badly contaminated.' 
'Yes, sir.' The sergeant took charge. 'All right. You, you, and you --- get hold of 'im. Careful, now! I don't want 'im dropped, d'you hear?'
'Wait,' said Rowlands, addressing Hawkins. 'Are you sure this is a good idea? Even if the area has been contaminated, as you say, surely the police ought to see the body in situ, and form their own conclusions?'
But the wing commander was adamant: 'It's already past one o'clock. Even if he were to be alerted at once, Inspector Strong's cohorts could hardly get here much before sundown. In an hour or so, they'd be blundering around in the dark. I don't suppose it would make much difference to you, Mr Rowlands, but Wicken Fen is very dark indeed at night. We're miles from any town or village here. You might almost think,' he added, in a more reflective tone, 'that we'd stepped back four hundred years...'
His words were drowned out by the droning of an aircraft overhead --- one of the 'Lancs' returning to base, perhaps. The sound seemed to wake him from the dream of the ancient past in which he'd briefly indulged. 'Carry on, Sergeant,' he said; then, 'I'll give you and your daughter a lift back to Mildenhall, Mr Rowlands. Since you'll have realised by now that there's nothing left for you to find here.'
It wasn't a request. Nor could Rowlands see that there was anything to be gained from refusing the offer. 'Thank you,' he said. 'We'd appreciate that, wouldn't we, Anne?'
'But...' she began; then, perhaps realising the futility of protesting further, lapsed into silence. 
Meanwhile, with a good deal of grunting and muttering, the three servicemen, exhorted by the sergeant, lifted their burden --- made heavier by the water with which its clothes were saturated --- and began lugging it along the path. Hawkins followed at a distance, with the Rowlandses, father and daughter, some paces behind him. None of them, evidently, felt inclined to talk. Rowlands himself felt utterly dejected. He'd been a fool to get drawn into this, he thought --- and yet, after all, what else could he have done? His beloved Anne was breaking her heart over a man who might turn out to be no more than a ruthless thug. If Hawkins was right about the murder method (and why should he make it up?) then the finger of suspicion pointed to a man who'd been trained, as Wawrzkowicz undoubtedly had, in such brutally effective ways of killing. 
He trudged on, his feet squelching unpleasantly in their wet shoes. He was glad, at least of Rex's presence beside him, which would prevent him from further mishaps, he hoped. They passed the brick kilns, where the rest of the Mildenhall search party was still looking for clues that would tell of recent occupancy. A few more of these --- cigarette butts, and scraps of food waste --- had been turned up. 'We'll find him, if he's anywhere close at hand,' said Hawkins complacently. 'He can't have gone far... not without transport. Speaking of which, I wonder how you got here, Mr Rowlands? It's a long way from any railway station, and you're hardly in a position to drive.'
'Oh, we like walking, don't we, Anne?' said Rowlands, not answering the question. Hawkins said nothing to this, and the rest of the journey back across the marshland passed in a silence broken only by the grunts and muttered curses of those carrying the body, as they stumbled over the waterlogged ground. At length they reached the clearing at the edge of the fen, where a lorry and staff car were parked. Here, Hawkins gave orders that Pryce's body was to be lifted into the back of the truck. 'And mind you cover it with a tarpaulin,' he said to the sergeant who'd been in charge of conveying the pathetic burden thus far. 'We don't want it leaking water all over the show.'
Once the corpse was stowed, and the men who'd brought it back had clambered up beside it, Hawkins addressed his reluctant companions. 'I'll be returning to the airbase myself. There's not much more I can do here, now that the light's going.' He gave a mirthless chuckle. 'It looks as if your Mr Wawrzkowicz has got himself a stay of execution... for now.' Rowlands felt his daughter give an indignant start, and he at once put a restraining hand on her arm. 'He does seem to have evaded capture rather successfully,' he said. 'And in these inclement weather conditions, it isn't every man who could have done that.'
'Oh, he's managed to dodge us so far,' Hawkins conceded, as the three of them got into the staff car, in which the driver was already waiting. 'But we'll catch him in the end, you'll see.' He gave a terse order to the WAAF seated behind the wheel, and the car set off along the lane that led past the keeper's cottage to the main road. Twenty minutes later, as they were approaching the gates of the airfield, Hawkins broke the silence once more: 'I assume you'd like to be dropped in the village, Mr Rowlands? Since I gather you're staying in Mildenhall. Of course you've still plenty of time, if you have to get back to... Brighton, isn't it? The trains do run until quite late.'
'I don't imagine the police would be very pleased if I were to leave now,' replied Rowlands drily. 'There's bound to be an inquest during the next few days --- and I'm a material witness.'
'Yes, but...' Hawkins seemed momentarily taken aback. 'This is a military matter. I don't think the, ah, observations of a civilian... such as yourself...' He broke off, but the inference was clear. A blind man's evidence could count for nothing, when set against that of a high-ranking RAF officer like himself. Perhaps Hawkins realised he'd gone too far --- or recalled that the blind man in question had 'form' as a detective, for he added, 'Of course, I'm sure your observations can only be of value, but...'   
Rowlands smiled. 'I think we'd better leave that to the police to decide. But since we're at the airfield, I'd better have a word with Group Captain Forrester.' Hawkins made no reply to this beyond a non-committal grunt, but Rowlands guessed he was not best pleased to have this outsider barging in on what he plainly thought of as a matter for the RAF alone. Both knew that, outsider or not, Rowlands had been given permission by Forrester to investigate as he saw fit. And so, after Anne had taken her leave of her father and gone to report to her section leader, the two men crossed the tarmac to the building where Forrester's office was to be found, both (Rowlands suspected) heartily wishing the other gone.
They found the group captain dictating a letter to his secretary: '... and so I would be obliged if filming could be restricted to those parts of the airfield not currently being used for operations... comma... given that... comma... as I have explained... comma... our missions reach a critical stage within the next few weeks... full-stop. I am... etcetera, etcetera. Two copies of that, please, Aircraftwoman Morris.'
'Yes, sir.'
'Ah, there you are, Hawkins!' went on Forrester, when the WAAF had left the room. 'And Mr Rowlands, too. Sorry to keep you waiting. It's this wretched film business I was telling you about, Hawkins. They want to start as soon as possible, and won't be put off any longer. To be perfectly frank, the prospect of having a lot of film Johnnies hanging about when we're trying to carry out a major operation doesn't fill me with joy, but you know what those War Office panjandrums are like. They've been on at me for months to set this up --- apparently it's a vital part of the war effort. Keeping morale up, by showing what a wonderful job the RAF is doing... Hello!' He must have seen something in their faces, for his tone became grave. 'What's happened?'
'It's Pryce,' said Hawkins. 'He's been found. Stone dead, as it happens. We're bringing the body back, now.' Because at that moment there came the low rumble of an army lorry, pulling into the yard outside the building, followed by the shouted orders of the sergeant supervising the recovery mission. At this, Forrester got up from his desk and went over to the window, where he stood for a moment or two, watching what was going on. 'You'd better tell me what happened.'
'Perhaps you should ask Mr Rowlands here,' said the wing commander acidly. 'He found the body.'
'I was the first to stumble across it, certainly,' said Rowlands. He thought it best not to mention that Anne had been with him. 'But it was Wing Commander Hawkins who identified Mr Pryce. I gather he'd been missing from the airfield for a number of days?'
'That's right,' said Forrester. 'He had some leave owing, and so his absence wasn't noted at first. When he failed to return after a week, we thought he must have gone AWOL, didn't we, Hawkins? Happens sometimes, when a man's under a lot of strain.'
'And had he been?'
'No more than usual,' replied the group captain. 'But then Pryce was always a bit of an odd man out. Bit of a drinker, too, by all accounts. It wasn't the first time he'd gone off on a "bender". He'd disappear for a day or two, then come back with a very sore head. Had to stop his pay once or twice on that account. Bad example to the younger chaps. Yes, he had his faults, did Wally Pryce. Damn good ground engineer, though. We can ill afford to lose a man of his calibre.' He sighed. 'You'd better fill me in on the details. Where was he found?' 
'Wicken Fen.'
'What on earth was he doing there?'
'No idea, sir.'
 'Well, no doubt we'll find out, in due course... And the cause of death?'
'He was dumped in the lake, having first been garrotted,' said Hawkins. 'A method, I think you'll agree, that points to its being one of our Polish friends who killed him.'
'What --- Wawrzkowicz, you mean? Are you sure about this?.'
'He was hiding out in the area,' said the wing commander. 'We found the motorbike, and signs that a man had been living rough. It all fits.'
'There's no actual proof that Wawrzkowicz killed Pryce,' said Rowlands. 'Nor that he was ever at Wicken Fen.' He knew as he said it that this would be easy enough to refute. The evidence of the handkerchief, which had led him and Anne to the Polish fighter's lair, was enough by itself to condemn him. Fortunately, he was the only one present who knew about the handkerchief. 	
'You're forgetting that Wawrzkowicz is already wanted for one murder, Mr Rowlands.' Hawkins sounded far from dismayed at this fact. 'I can't think of a better suspect for this crime, either.' 
The group captain groaned. 'Whatever the truth of the matter, the police will have to be informed. Not only have we failed to track down the murderer of young Bly, but now there's been a second murder. It doesn't look good for Mildenhall. And with this confounded film crew due to arrive any minute, I'm at a loss as to how to keep the matter out of the press.'
'Can't you cancel the filming, Group Captain --- or at least postpone it? We're trying to fight a war here.'
'I'm well aware of that, Wing Commander,' replied Forrester testily. 'Good Lord, what now?' Because at that moment, there came the sound of a car pulling up outside. A police Wolseley, unless Rowlands was very much mistaken. Car doors slammed and there came the tramp of boots on the gravel. Moments later, voices were heard in the outer office --- one of them, with its accents of Midlothian, all too familiar to Rowlands. 'No, I'll see mysel' in, thanks, lassie,' said this voice. The door opened. 'Now, which one o' ye gentlemen is Group Captain Forrester?'
'I'm Forrester,' said the man thus addressed. 'Might I ask who you are?'
But before he could receive an answer to his question, the Scotsman gave a dry chuckle. 'Well, well, Fred Rowlands, as I live and breathe! Why am I not surprised to see you here?'


### Chapter Eight ###

'Superintendent Douglas,' said Rowlands. 'A little far from your usual patch this, isn't it?'
'Och, I get about these days, ye ken,' was the reply. 'But we mustn't stand here blethering... So ye tell me ye're the man in charge,' he went on, addressing Forrester. 'Yes, I'm group captain here, as I said,' the other replied tetchily. 'But I'm still waiting for an explanation...'
'As you'll have gathered, sir, the name's Douglas. Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police. But I've been seconded to Special Branch for the purposes of this investigation. This...' --- indicating one of the men who'd accompanied him into the by-now crowded office --- 'is Inspector Peace. Luckily his Christian name's not Charlie, eh?' he chuckled. 'And the officer waiting outside is Sergeant Dennison. I didn't catch your name, sir,' he added to Hawkins, although it had not been offered. Hawkins supplied it.
'Well, now that we all know each other,' said Douglas affably, 'mebbe we can get down to brass tacks.'
'Just a minute, Superintendent,' interrupted the by-now exasperated Forrester. 'I'd like to know what this is all about. As Chief Constable Valentine must have told, you, the police already have the matter in hand, and so...'
'Ah, Ronnie Valentine, is it?' replied the other. 'Good man. But it's not at his behest I'm here.'
'Then... if it's not in connection with the Bly murder case, I fail to see why...' began Forrester. The Superintendent cut across him. 'I'm looking for a certain Walter Pryce. I understand he works at Mildenhall.'
'Yes, that's correct. But...' Forrester seemed momentarily dumbfounded. 'I've some questions for him, that's all,' went on Douglas. 'It shouldn't take up too much of his --- or your --- time.'
It was Hawkins who broke the silence. 'I'm afraid you've had a wasted journey, Superintendent. Pryce can't speak to you --- or to anyone else ever again. The fact is, he was found dead about two hours ago. My men and I have just brought his body back to the airfield.'
Now it was Douglas's turn to fall silent. 'I see,' he said at last. 'It's like that, is it? Well, I cannae say I'm surprised.'
'Superintendent, I do wish you'd explain yourself,' said Forrester irritably. 'I mean, what exactly do you --- or rather, did you --- want with Walter Pryce?'
Again, the superintendent took a moment before replying. 'Pryce is --- or was --- a person of interest to the police. You'll understand that I can't say anything more, Group Captain. I had hoped to interrogate the man, but you tell me that is no longer possible. Further than that, I cannae go.'
'But surely...' The group captain's legendary temper seemed about to erupt. 'Surely to blazes you can tell us what Pryce was supposed to have done? Was it something criminal? Damn it, Superintendent, as the officer commanding this airfield, I have a right to know!'
'All I can tell you, sir, is that the man --- Walter Pryce --- was involved with some very dubious people,' said Douglas, seemingly unperturbed by this outburst. 'We --- that is, Special Branch --- have been aware of his activities for some time. Matters of national security prevent me from going into more detail, but I can assure you, Group Captain...'
'Matters of national poppycock!' snapped Forrester. 'The man worked here, at Mildenhall. At the very least, I should know what he was to have been accused of.'
'It's surely rather academic, what Pryce did or didn't do,' put in Hawkins sardonically. 'Since he's dead.'
'Just so,' said Douglas. 'Just so. And you're absolutely right, Group Captain,' he added ruefully. 'You should indeed be put in the picture. And if it were left up to me...'
'Oh, no need to say more.' Forrester sounded as if he regretted his outburst. 'When it's a matter of national security...'
'What I can tell you,' said Douglas, 'is that we have reason to believe that Pryce was a member of a criminal gang. Mebbe not a very important member, but certainly a cog in the machine.'
'D'you mean he was involved in... in fraud of some kind? Embezzlement, or some such?'
'Exactly so, sir.'
'Then why the devil didn't you say so in the first place?' demanded Forrester. 'If the man was a crook, we should have been told. Lord knows what damage he and this gang you mention might have done to the war effort at Mildenhall. Why, the man was one of our most trusted ground engineers. I can't imagine how he could have got tied up in some gang of embezzlers. Are you sure you've got the right man, Superintendent?'
'Och aye, Group Captain. There's no doubt about it, I'm afraid. But I can tell you that Pryce's activities had nothing to do with the work he was doing at Mildenhall. You can set your mind at rest about that.'

'Well now,' said Alasdair Douglas, taking a deep draught of his pint with a sigh of satisfaction. 'You do seem to have a knack for blundering into dangerous situations, Fred my lad --- to say nothing of stumbling across dead bodies!'
'I can promise you,' said Rowlands. 'I don't seek them out.'
'No, that's Rex's job, isn't it, old fellow?' Douglas reached down to pat the dog's head. 'We ought to have him in the Force. Aye,' he went on, as he started to fill his pipe. 'I'd say you've an unco' nasty little murder there. Nae doubt about it.' 
They were sitting in the bar of the King's Head, at which establishment Rowlands was once more putting up for the night, while the superintendent was staying at a rival establishment, the Crown. Inevitably, the topic which had brought them both to Mildenhall was being discussed --- the fact that there had now been two murders at the airfield. That the methods used had been very different in each case --- one apparently the result of a row that had turned ugly, the other a premeditated assassination, was neither here nor there, said the superintendent. 'It's my belief there's a connection between the twae killings. The question is: what?'  
Earlier that day, the two friends had accompanied the RAF officers to the airfield's Sick Bay, where a temporary morgue had been set up. Here, to the same cold and cheerless room where, not three weeks before, the corpse of Jonathan Bly had found a temporary resting-place, the body of Walter Pryce had been brought. The five men --- now including the Medical Officer --- had stood in silence around the plain deal table on which, now stripped of its sodden uniform and boots, the mortal remains of the ground engineer lay. 'I'll have to wait until I've done the post-mortem, before I can give you a better idea of when he died,' said the doctor. 'But I think it's pretty obvious what killed him. Strangulation with a ligature --- a length of wire in this case --- followed by immersion in freezing water. If he wasn't already dead when he went into the water, the shock of it would have been enough to stop his heart.'
'Aye, a nasty little case,' repeated Douglas, applying a match to his pipe. 'Whoever did for Mr Pryce was taking no chances that he'd get up again.'
'Are you saying it was another member of the gang who killed him?' 
'The gang? Och, well --- in a manner of speaking,' was the reply. Douglas puffed away at his pipe for a moment or two. 'The fact is,' he went on. 'There is no gang --- or at least, not the kind that specialises in crimes of larceny. The "gang" I'm thinking of, and of which Walter Pryce was a lowly member, deals in a very different sort of crime. Subterfuge. Betrayal. Murder. Och aye, they're a wicked crew. Although on the face of it, they're just like you and me.' He took another pull on his pipe. 'You won't, I fancy, have heard of National Resurgence?'
Rowlands said that he had not.
'Nor of the League of St George?' Rowlands shook his head. 'It's hardly surprising. They're a secretive lot. It's taken the best part of a year for our people to find out what they've been up to.'
'And what's that?' said Rowlands, although he was beginning to have an idea. Quite apart from the suggestiveness of the names of the organisations to which Douglas had alluded, there was the fact of their evidently clandestine nature. He knew a bit about the secret world and how it operated. 'Selling information,' replied the superintendent, confirming this suspicion. 'Betraying confidences. Undermining the war effort, in short.'
'They sound like dangerous types.'
'Och, they are. And that's not the worst of it. Infiltration. That's what they're about. Getting their people into all the sensitive areas of the British state. The Law. The Army. The Church. Even Parliament. There's nowhere they havnae got their nasty claws into!' said Douglas, in a tone of disgust. 'Why if I were to tell you about some of the people I've had the misfortune to have to interrogate these past few months, you'd think the country was on the brink of anarchy.'
'So you're saying that Pryce was one of them?' Rowlands felt a twinge of the distaste he'd felt on a previous encounter with a traitor --- also now dead. What drove such people to betray all that they should hold dear? Country. Family. Friends. It went against nature... unless it was this --- the thrill of transgression --- which was the attraction? 'Aye,' said Douglas. 'We've pretty conclusive evidence. Although he was small fry, ye ken?' He puffed away on his pipe. 'But still dangerous. We were to have arrested him on suspicion of carrying out certain acts of sabotage. Damaging telephone boxes being one such. Writing pro-German slogans on the walls. No doubt he'd have graduated to more serious crimes. Leaking the location of RAF airfields in the region being the obvious one. Only somebody prevented him.'
Both men were silent a moment as they contemplated this undeniable fact. Then Rowlands said, 'Who do you think is behind it all? The ringleaders, I mean.'
'Och, there are quite a number of 'em,' said the other. 'People with grievances tend to find one another. Some of 'em are simply admirers of the Führer's way of doing things  --- especially when it comes to his treatment of Jews. Others have some axe to grind about tax --- they're against it, usually --- or the poor having too many children, or some such... What unites them all is a desire to overthrow the government and install their own people in positions of power. They claim --- at least, the ones who are open about it --- that they just want peace with Germany. But really they're in favour of Nazi rule, and the elimination of anyone who'd stand in the way of this.'
'Ah,' said Rowlands. 'I'm beginning to see where this is going.'
'Death squads,' said the superintendent. 'Britain's very own Gestapo. Apparently, there's a list of people who are to be removed. Politicians. Journalists. University lecturers. People in public life, in short --- especially if they're Jewish.'
'You must have some idea who these conspirators are,' said Rowlands. 'I mean, surely it's illegal to go around saying you're going to kill people?'
'Och, they're cunning enough not to be caught saying so in public --- or in print,' was the reply. 'And yes, we do know who some of 'em are, but we can't touch 'em, because of that. Also, some of our suspects are very prominent men. A few women, too. We've a Conservative MP, and a duke or two... You know one of 'em, I believe? Lord Edgecombe.'
'Yes.'
'There's a general, and a famous conductor, and a newspaper proprietor... Och, they've infiltrated every walk of life. Trouble, is, the more powerful they are, the less we can do about it. Your friend Johnny Edgecombe is a case in point...'
'He isn't my friend,' said Rowlands. A thought, which had been bothering him for some time, now surfaced. 'Are you telling me,' he went on, 'that you suspect one of these people is in a position of influence at RAF Mildenhall?'
'That's about the size of it,' replied Douglas. 'Walter Pryce was just a pawn in the game. A puppet, if you like. Somebody else was pulling the strings.'
'It's why you said nothing of anything of this to Forrester, isn't it?' 
'Aye, well...'
'I can't believe he can be involved in anything so nefarious. Why, the man's a war hero.'
'You'd be surprised who is and who isn't caught up in this,' said the superintendent wearily. 'When you've been face to face with as many potential traitors as I have during these past few months, you'll find nothing can surprise you any more.'
The two men sat in silence for a while, smoking and drinking their beer. The landlord, who had left them to themselves during the earlier part of the evening, now put his head around the door of the private room Rowlands had requested for their supper, to ask if the gentlemen would require any more drinks before he closed up for the night. Both said they'd have a whisky as a nightcap --- Rowlands in order to keep his friend company, rather than because he needed anything to help him sleep. He had the feeling that, after the day he'd had --- the finding of the body in Wicken Fen, followed by the shocking revelations about the dead man's alleged treachery --- he'd fall asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. 
Douglas, too, was yawning. Only when the drinks had been brought, and the door closed once more behind the attentive Catchpole, did he reveal that his mind was still working away at the case. 'I'm interested in this Polish gentleman,' he said, taking a sip of his Scotch. 'Your Mr Hawkins --- Wing Commander I should say --- seems very certain that he's the one who put that fancy necklace around Pryce's neck. Any truth in it, do you think?'
'I'm the wrong man to ask, superintendent.'
'Och, you can drop all that between friends. Just plain "Douglas" will do.' For some reason, Rowlands had never got around to using the other's Christian name in all the years he had known him, although he was 'Fred' to Alasdair Douglas. 'I suppose you're referring,' the latter now went on, 'to the business with the lassie. Miss Anne. Sweet on the feller, isn't she?'
'They're friends,' admitted Miss Anne's father reluctantly. 'But I don't see Wawrzkowicz as a murderer, frankly. From all I can discover... and not just from Anne... the man's a straight arrow. A patriot, and a resistance fighter. Even before Walter Pryce's body was discovered, Hawkins was already prejudiced against him.'
'Because he's a foreigner, presumably?'
'Partly that. There's a lot of ill feeling against him at the airfield, on account of the earlier killing.'
'Ah yes, the murder of Mr Bly,' said Douglas, taking another sip of his whisky. 'Did he do it?'
'There's some evidence --- mainly circumstantial --- to suggest that he and Bly were on bad terms. But enough conflicting evidence to cast doubt on whether he had anything to do with Bly's shooting.'
'There's the fact of his running away,' said the other thoughtfully. 'That does suggest guilt.'
'It doesn't look good, I agree. But I think he believes he won't get a fair trial here.'
'Something in that. So who do you think did it?'
'I haven't the faintest idea,' said Rowlands. 'And if I did, it wouldn't be very professional of me to tell you --- or for you to listen to what could only be unfounded suspicions.'
'True,' was the reply. 'But we're not at present in a court of law --- nor even a police station --- and as I'm new to this case, I'd like your opinion on it, and on any likely suspects.'
Rowlands hesitated, covering this by lighting another cigarette. 'I think,' he said at last, 'that you might start by talking to some of the people Walter Pryce had dealings with at Mildenhall, over these past few weeks. Starting with the night of Jonathan Bly's murder.'
'And who might these people be?'
Rowlands told him. When he said one name, the superintendent let out a low whistle. 'Haverstock's boy? Well, well. That is interesting. And you say he was overheard quarrelling with Pryce on the night young Bly was killed?'
'Yes. But it doesn't mean he had anything to do with Pryce's death. And Bly was his friend...'
'Nevertheless,' said the other. 'I think we'll have your Mr Moncrieff in for a chat as a matter of urgency.'

'How many times do I have to say it?' said Rupert Moncrieff irritably. It was around ten o'clock on the morning of the following day. At the superintendent's invitation, Rowlands was sitting in on the interview the former, assisted by Inspector Peace, was conducting with the flier, whose manner throughout had been one of injured innocence. 'I didn't kill Wally Pryce. And I've no idea who did.'
'All right, Flight Lieutenant. You've made that very clear,' said Douglas. 'But you don't deny you and Pryce had a falling-out, the night of the dance?'
'The man was about to slink off, leaving me with a kite that needed servicing,' was the reply. 'I told him to pull his finger out, that's all.'
'A witness heard you tell Pryce that he was going to "get his fingers burnt" if he wasn't careful,' said Douglas. 'And then you said, "I'm not happy about this, Pryce. It's got to stop, do you hear?"
'I don't remember saying that.'
'But you did say it. Can you think what it was you meant?'
'I haven't the faintest idea.' Moncrieff sounded rattled. 'I... I must have been talking about his general attitude, I suppose. Honestly, Inspector...'
'Superintendent,' said Douglas. 'I'm only trying to establish what happened, Flight Lieutenant. Two men are dead --- one of them a friend of yours. The other was a man with whom you worked closely. You must see that anything you can tell us about your dealings with either is of interest to the police?'
'Yes, but...'
'Perhaps,' said Peace, who had been taking notes 'you could start by telling us your movements yesterday, Mr Moncrieff?'
'All right,' said the youth sullenly. 'Although I still don't see why I should be singled out. I was in the Ops Room waiting for a briefing most of yesterday afternoon --- which is when Pryce's body was found, wasn't it? Before that, I was in the Mess, having my lunch. There are a dozen men who'll vouch for me in both places.'
'I'll need names.'
'Certainly. Six of them are my bomber crew. The rest...'
'Six names will do admirably,' said the superintendent. 'You can let the inspector here have a list. Thank you, Flight Lieutenant, that will be all.' As Moncrieff got to his feet, Douglas added as if he had just thought of it: 'Your father, Lord Haverstock... I gather he's a member of National Resurgence?'
Moncrieff seemed momentarily nonplussed. 'I... I believe he is. I don't concern myself overmuch with my father's activities. What of it?'
'Oh, nothing. It was just a passing thought,' said the other airily.
'So that was why you were so interested in talking to Moncrieff,' said Rowlands, when the young man had gone. 'You think there's some connection between these National Resurgence people and Pryce's death.'
'Tell you one thing, he wasn't too happy when you asked him about his dad,' chuckled Peace. 'Face like thunder, he had.'
'I think it's a possibility that there's a connection,' Douglas replied. 'Although I don't imagine the noble lord did the deed himself.'
'Then who...?'
'Och, that remains to be seen,' said Douglas. 'But I think it's no accident that Pryce's body was found within a stone's throw of Mildenhall. Somebody here decided he knew more than was good for him --- and decided to do something about it.'
There was the sound of a car ---  a police Wolseley --- drawing up outside. 'Ah ha!' said Douglas. 'Who can this be? Why,' he went on, opening the Venetian blind a crack. 'If it isn't my old friend, Ronnie Valentine! I wonder what brings him here?'
''Morning, Superintendent,' said that gentleman, as he walked into the office which had been allocated to Douglas, as the latter rose to greet him. 'Inspector Peace. And Mr Rowlands, too. You know Inspector Strong, I take it?'
'Aye. We met yesterday, did we not?' The two London-based detectives, with Rowlands making a third, had been on the point of leaving the makeshift mortuary where Pryce's body had been laid out, when the local police inspector and his junior officers had arrived. There had been awkward introductions. It had struck Rowlands at the time that the presence of a senior Scotland Yard detective --- uninvited, too --- could not have been welcome to Strong, who had, however, put a brave face on it.
'Inspector Strong has some news for you, Superintendent,' said the Chief Constable, scarcely able to conceal his glee. 'There's been a development --- eh, Strong?'
'That's right, sir.'  The inspector allowed a brief pause to elapse, as if savouring the  moment. It would be satisfying to wipe the Special Branch officer's eye. 'Where's that evidence, Jackson?' he demanded of his subordinate. 'Here, sir.'
'Let me have it. Careful, mind! Although,' Strong went on, as the object --- whatever it was --- was produced. 'I don't suppose as there'll be any fingerprints worth the taking, but you never know.'
'Hmm,' said Douglas, when the object was shown to him. 'Handsome bit o' kit, wouldn't you say, Jack?' Peace grunted his agreement. 'Silver, from the look of it. Cigarette case,' he added, for Rowlands's benefit. 'Sunburst design, with an emblem. Badge o' some sort...'
'Looks to me like the Polish airforce badge,' said Valentine. 'We'll have it confirmed by their people, of course.'
Douglas did not respond to this, but went on: 'Engraved, I shouldn't wonder...' Then, to Strong: 'Dinnae fash yersel' mon. I'll take care not to get my prints on it.' There was a soft click, as he opened the case. 'Three cigarettes left in it.' He sniffed them. 'Some foreign brand. And here's the inscription... "JSW, May 1942". Where was this found?'
'Sticking out of the frozen mud at the edge of the mere,' said Strong, with unconcealed triumph. 'Not two yards from where the body of Walter Pryce was found. We carried out a thorough investigation of the site at first light this morning,' he added. 'Not that there was much to see, with the body taken away before we'd had a chance to observe it at the scene, and the surrounding area trampled to bits, but we did find this, so it wasn't a complete waste of effort.'
'No, indeed,' said Valentine. 'A very good bit of police work, I'd say.'
'Thank you, sir. Stands to reason that whoever did for Pryce must've dropped it in the struggle.'
'Not hard to work out who that might have been,' said Valentine. 'The initials and the Polish emblem confirm what we've suspected all along. Wawrzkowicz is your man --- for both murders. I've prepared an arrest warrant.'
'Ye'll have to catch him first,' said the superintendent sardonically. 'Seems to me, the feller doesn't want to be found.'   


### Chapter Nine ###

When the chief constable and Inspector Strong had gone to put the group captain in the picture about the latest development, Rowlands was left with the two Special Branch men. On the desk in front of Douglas was the cigarette case, which the latter had prevailed upon Strong to leave with him for the time being. 'I'll let you have it back within the hour,' he said to the inspector. 'Just as soon as I've confirmed something to my satisfaction, ye ken.'
As the cigarette case had now been tested for fingerprints --- Sergeant Dennison having obligingly fetched the kit with its insufflator and powder from the car --- there was no reason why it shouldn't be handled. The fact that, despite the sergeant's best efforts, the only prints to have been found were a blurred finger and thumb on the case's outer edge, had seemed to delight the superintendent, rather than otherwise. 'Wore gloves, didn't he?' chuckled Douglas, adding cryptically: 'All criminals do, nowadays. They've read it in Ellery Queen.'
Now he sat, filling his pipe and muttering to himself. 'Well, well. This is a turn-up for the books, as they say. He's getting desperate, is our man...'
'Who are you talking about?' asked Rowlands.
'Why, our murderer. He's getting impatient with the slow pace of this investigation, and wants to hurry it along.' He scribbled something on a sheet of paper, tore it in half, and handed it to his sergeant. Now then, Dennison, I'll need ye to fetch this young lady --- Miss Anne Rowlands.'
'No,' said Rowlands. 'There's no need for that.'
'Ye'll find her in the women's section. Shouldn't be too hard to find, in a place so overrun with men! Ask her to come back with ye, will ye? Tell her Superintendent Douglas wants a word.'
'You've got my evidence, as regards the inquest,' protested Rowlands --- for at Douglas's behest, the same young sergeant had earlier taken it down. 'Surely that's enough? I was the one who found Pryce's body. Anne can't add anything to that.'
'Mebbe, mebbe not,' was the infuriating reply. 'I'd like to hear it from her, if ye don't mind. Have ye a clean handkerchief?' he added mysteriously. Rowlands produced one. 'Thanks. Ye'll have it back directly,' said his friend.
Anne was accompanied to this, her second police interrogation, by the Hellcat... that is, Section Leader Henderson, Rowlands corrected himself. 'I thought it best if Aircraftwoman Rowlands had another woman with her,' opined this lady. 'Several of my girls have been quite upset by the constant grilling they've had to endure from the police. Really, Superintendent, it can't go on much longer! It's putting some of them off their duties --- and whatever you men might think,' she added sternly, 'the Womens' Auxiliary Air Force has an important part to play in the war effort.'
'I don't doubt it, m'am,' said Douglas hastily. 'And I'm sorry if the young ladies are upset. But you must see, Section Leader, that with two murders at Mildenhall...'
'Walter Pryce's death was murder, then --- and not just an accident?' interrupted the woman officer. 'I find that hard to believe. The man was a notorious drunkard. He must have stumbled into the mere in an intoxicated state...'
'He might've, but he didn't,' interjected Peace.
'And you are?' The Hellcat's tone was chilly enough to freeze the blood.
'My apologies,' said Douglas. 'This is Inspector Peace, my colleague at the Metropolitan Police. He'd helping me in my investigations into another matter, which may or may not be connected to Pryce's death.'
'I see. Well, he'd better get on with investigating. We can't afford to waste much more time on this sorry business. I see you're still here, Mr Rowlands! Think you've any good leads as to who might be responsible for these dreadful acts?' 
'A few, Section Leader,' he replied humbly. 'Hmph. Glad to hear it,' she said, plumping herself down beside him on one of the chairs set again the wall. 'I suppose you detective types stick together. If you're going to ask your questions, I should ask them,' she added, to the two policemen. 'I've work to do.'
And in fact it didn't take long for Anne, prompted by Douglas, with an occasional word thrown in by the inspector, to give her evidence --- all of it recorded by the dutiful Sergeant Dennison, the scratching of whose pencil could be heard throughout the interview. 
Yes, she had accompanied her father to Wicken Fen, having learnt that Jan's... that is, Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz's... motorcycle had been found abandoned there. Yes, they had searched an area --- the old brick kilns --- known to her from previous visits with Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz. No, they had found no sign of him... or nothing that might not have been attributed to the presence of somebody else, she added, with scrupulous honesty... and no, she did not know where he was now. It wasn't until they were alerted by Rex's barking... 
At the sound of his name, Rex thumped his tail. 'This is the animal in question, I take it?' interrupted the superintendent. 'Yes. He's Daddy's dog.' For the first time, Anne seemed to falter. 'He... Rex... was barking his head off, as I said, and so I ran to where he was...' Again she broke off.
'Is this really necessary?' said Rowlands. 'Surely my statement should be enough?'
'No, Daddy. I want to tell it.' In a firmer voice, Anne went on: 'There was a... a body lying there, half-submerged at the edge of the lake. I... I thought at first it might be Jan... but when I drew closer, I saw that the uniform was all wrong. Then my father turned him over... the dead man... so that I could see his face. It was horribly discoloured --- a dreadful purple colour --- with the features all distorted... because of the wire around his neck. I... I think he'd been strangled.' The section leader drew in her breath sharply at this. 'But I saw that it wasn't Jan. Then, when Wing Commander Hawkins appeared, a few minutes afterwards, he... he identified the man as Mr Pryce.'
'Thank you,' said Douglas gently. 'You're a brave lassie. I think that'll be all for today.'
Anne let out a sigh of relief. 'May I go then?'
'In a wee moment. I've just one more thing to ask ye.' He must have uncovered the cigarette case at that moment, whisking away the handkerchief like a conjurer. 'Have ye seen this item before?'
Anne's gasp was answer enough. 'That's Jan's case!' she cried. 'Where did you get it?' Then, as the implications of this discovery struck her: 'Have you found him? He's not...?'
'Mr Wawrzkowicz is in perfect health, as far as I know,' was the reply. 'And no, we havnae found him --- yet. Don't touch,' he added sharply. 'That's a piece of evidence. It was found this morning at Wicken Fen --- lying in the mud, a few feet away from where the body of Mr Pryce had been lying.'
'But... but that's impossible!' said Anne. 'I'd have seen it, if it had been there yesterday.'
'Just what I thought mysel',' said Douglas, with grave satisfaction.
There was a silence after Anne, accompanied by Section Leader Henderson, had returned to her duties. Then Douglas said, 'Phew! Quite a woman, that Miss Henderson. No nonsense about her.'
'You can say that again,' said Jack Peace. 'She made me feel about ten years old. Do I take it,' he went on, 'that we're taking over this case? Our local chappie won't be pleased about that!'
'I think we'll let Inspector Strong carry on the good work, for now,' was Douglas's reply. 'After all, he did find the cigarette case! And we've other fish to fry... I'll need to talk again to the group captain, and the feller who was with ye when ye found Pryce's body, Fred. Wing Commander...'
'Hawkins,' said Rowlands. 'Yes, he identified Pryce. I suppose he'll be called at the inquest, won't he?'
'Certainly,' said the superintendent. 'He's an important witness. I'm afraid,' he went on, 'we may have to call young Anne, after all.'
'But...'
'I'm sorry, but there it is. She's the only one who can say for certain that that's Wawrzkowicz's cigarette case. And she saw the body before Hawkins did.'
'So did I,' said Rowlands, exasperated. 'And I know you're going to say that I didn't actually see the corpse --- but I touched the blessed thing, didn't I? Fell over it, if you want to know. That was enough to tell me the man was dead, and had been for some time.'
'Look, if I can keep Anne out of it, I will,' said the superintendent. 'But I'm not making any promises. Och, look at the time! I'd best be making tracks if I'm to get back to London in time to make my report to the Home Office. I'll leave ye to make your peace... sorry, I couldnae resist it... wi' the guid Inspector Strong, Jack. See if ye can find out a bit more about what this chap Pryce was up to at Mildenhall, in the days before his death.'
'Sir.' 
'And I can give ye a lift back to the pub, Fred, if ye'd like.'
Rowlands said that he'd appreciate that. Apart from the fact that it was now getting on for lunchtime, he needed to make some telephone calls. The most urgent of these was to Major Fraser, to ask for more time off --- even though Rowlands was already in danger of using up what remained of his fortnight's holiday allowance. Now, with the prospect of being called as a principal witness at the inquest on Monday, he knew he'd have to stay at Mildenhall for at least the next two days. So far the Major, as Head of St Dunstan's, had been sympathetic to Rowlands' occasional absences from the office, in pursuit of what the former called his 'sleuthing activities'. But there could be a limit to tolerance ---especially as this case showed every sign of being a long drawn-out one, with no solution in sight. 
And there was Edith to put in the picture, Rowlands reminded himself. He'd have to do his best to reassure her that Anne would be kept out of things as far as possible --- although he himself felt far from sure that this would be the case.

By the time he'd made the two trunk calls, and consumed a pint of beer and a pie, it was getting on for half past two when Rowlands got back to Mildenhall. It had occurred to him, while he was having his lunch, that --- since he was obliged to stay in the vicinity of the airfield for at least the next forty-eight hours --- he could do worse than talk to some of the men with whom Walter Pryce had worked. Of course the police, under the command of Inspector Strong, would be doing that, too, in order to trace the ground engineer's last movements. But, armed with the knowledge that the superintendent had shared with him about Pryce's activities as a saboteur, he thought a little further investigation couldn't hurt. 
If he discovered anything about what Pryce had been up to, in the days leading up to his murder, he would pass it on to Douglas straight away. The little his friend had said about the activities of National Resurgence had indicated that it was a dangerous organisation, with which it would be foolish to tangle. But there was no harm in asking a few discreet questions, he thought.
As he passed through the gates, having identified himself once more to the guard, he found himself in a scene of pandemonium. Four large trucks had drawn up on the forecourt in front of the main group of buildings, and stood, idling their engines, to the consternation of a passing serviceman. 'Oi! You can't leave that lot 'ere! You're blocking the traffic. Take 'em round to the other side of the hangars!'
'I say, no need to blow your top! We've permission to be here, you know. Excelsior Film Company. It's on the side of the vans, if you don't believe me...'  With this, the speaker must have clambered out of one of the now-stationery trucks, followed by the rest of the crew, all talking at the tops of their voices, in order to be heard above the distant whine of aircraft engines being tested, and the roar of passing lorries ferrying equipment. As, guided by Rex, Rowlands began to navigate his way between the various obstacles --- piles of sandbags, abandoned bicycles --- with which the area was strewn, he caught snatches of talk, which recalled to mind his own, albeit brief, experiences in the film world:
'Lumme! Bit of hole this, isn't it? Are you sure we've come to the right place?'
'It's what it says on the map, duckie...'
 	'Where do we set up? I'll need somewhere I can plug in these lamps...'
'No, don't put that there. It'll just get in the way...'
'Are you sure  we've come to the right place?'
'Stands to reason it has to be, with that row going on. Deafening. I don't know how the actors are ever going to make themselves heard above those planes...'
'Where do you want these lamps?'
'Don't bother me with all that now, Norman. Brenda, have you got that letter from the Minister? I need to find the man in charge of this outfit. Remind me of his name again...'
'Forrester,' said the young woman thus addressed. 'Group Captain Forrester.' Something about her voice was familiar to Rowlands. It couldn't be... could it? 'That's the chap,' agreed the first speaker. 'Wonder where he hides out? He must have an office of some sort...' 
'Perhaps,' said Rowlands. 'I can be of help?'
'I say, that's most awfully decent of you,' said the man. 'Only we've got to get this lot under cover and get set up before the light fades --- for the exterior shots, don't you know?'
'Group Captain Forrester's office is over in that direction,' said Rowlands, gesticulating. 'I'll take you there, if you like, Mr... er...'
'Macpherson, Alexander --- but my friends call me Sandy,' replied the young man. 'I'm directing this thing, for my sins. Nice dog,' he added, bending down to scratch Rex's ears. 'Maybe we can work him in somewhere? People like dogs. They give a human touch --- or should that be a canine touch?' He laughed immoderately. 'Sorry! I do talk a lot of rot. Where did you say we have to go?' 
'It's this way,' said Rowlands. 'Jolly good,' said the other. 'Come along, Brenda --- and don't forget that letter.' The young woman thus addressed gave a slight cough. 'Oh. Yes. This is Brenda Pettifor, my assistant.'
'Frederick Rowlands.' He held out his hand. 'What nice manners some people, have,' she said as she took it. 'I do like to be properly introduced, don't you, Mr Rowlands?' 
'Oh yes,' he replied, keeping his expression neutral. It was one advantage of being blind, he thought, that one's face was so much less expressive than those of sighted people. He recalled the last time that he and this woman had met, the year before, in Oxford. She hadn't been called 'Brenda Pettifor' then. He guessed she was here for the same reasons that had brought her into the earlier case. That is, matters of national security. If she was at Mildenhall undercover, then things must be serious, indeed... 
Just then, the NCO who'd been attempting, with little success, to direct the traffic, came charging up. 'I said you can't leave these trucks here,' he panted. 'Blocking access to the airfield, they are.'
'All right, all right. We'll move them as soon as we can,' was the reply. 'Norman! Can you tell the chaps to shift their vehicles to a less awkward spot? This bloke --- sorry, what's your name?'
'Willets. I'm Warrant Officer here.'
'Warrant Officer Willets'll show you where to park... Now then, Mr Rowlands... or may I call you Fred? P'raps you could point us in the right direction?. Not time to lose, you know. Truth is, we got a bit lost on the way here. Godforsaken spot, isn't it? So we're a bit later arriving than we planned. As soon as I've let this Forrester chappie know we're here, I'd like to get set up for shooting the first scene. We've only got a week to do the whole thing --- that's all the time the War Office would allow us --- so we'll need to get on with it. Monty, you'd better come, too.'
Because they were joined at this moment by another member of the film crew, whom Macpherson introduced as 'Montague Morgan --- our script writer. Monty, this is Fred. He's kindly offered to act as guide.'
'So you're the man who puts words in people's mouths?' said Rowlands to Morgan, for something to say. 'Well, I try,' was the reply. 'But it's hopeless getting amateurs to learn lines. I just cobble some rough ideas together and hope for the best, you know?'
'Ah,' said Rowlands, none the wiser. Fortunately Macpherson was more than equal to picking up the conversational reins. 'Would you believe that this is my seventh film for the jolly old Ministry?' he said, evidently not expecting a reply. 'Last week we were shooting footage in Portsmouth, about the navy, weren't we, Monty? All those jolly Jack Tars... The week before that it was: "Housewives! Remember, Waste is the Enemy's Friend..." How to turn sheets sides-to-middle and use up food scraps. Award-winning stuff. Not that I'm complaining. Six months out of film school and I've already got my own camera crew. Pretty good going, don't you think?'
Rowlands agreed that it was. They reached the administration block and went in. 'All right,' said the irrepressible Macpherson to the WAAFs in the outer office. 'Which of you lovely ladies can take me to your leader?' 	
But the group captain, no doubt alerted by the sound of voices, chose that moment to put his head out. 'Ah, Rowlands, that you?' he said gruffly; then broke off when he saw the others. Before Rowlands could perform the introductions, Macpherson himself intervened. 'Group Captain Forrester, I presume?' he said. 'I'm Sandy Macpherson, from the Excelsior film company. I'm here to film your chaps doing whatever it is they do. Winning the war, one hopes!' His laughter was not echoed by Forrester, who merely cleared his throat in a peremptory manner and said, 'I hope it isn't going to take too long, Mr, er, Macpherson. As you say, we've a war to win.'
'Oh, we'll be out of your hair in a few days,' was the airy reply. 'Won't we, Brenda? My assistant, Miss Pettifor. She's the one who runs the whole show, aren't you, darling? We'd all be lost without Brenda. And this is Mr Morgan, my scriptwriter. Now, where can we set up?' When it was explained to the group captain that this would mean the film crew's taking over at least one room in the building in which they stood --- 'Your office for preference,' said Macpherson cheerfully --- as well as the 'Ops Room', or something as near as possible to it in appearance, the RAF officer seemed flabbergasted. 'But... but how am I to do any work, if my centre of operations is being overrun with camera crews, and the like?' he demanded. 'As for our Operations Room, that's in constant use. Having a film crew installed will create no end of difficulty.'
'Perhaps,' suggested Rowlands, 'you could allocate one of the offices not currently in use for Mr Macpherson's purposes, sir?' The Ops Room would prove more of a challenge to 'fake up', he supposed. Although Macpherson seemed sanguine about this. 'I'll just need a look at the various places where the action is,' he said. 'Then Norman --- he's our lighting bod, but he can turn his hand to set design, if pushed --- will see what he can do.'
'But surely,' said Forrester, a shade despairingly, 'you're just going to film the men getting ready to set off on a mission? Do you really need a "set" for that?'
'We do, if we're going to follow the script,' was the reply. 'That's Monty's department. You envisaged a scene at the beginning, with the Top Brass in the briefing room, didn't you, Monty old boy? Makes the whole thing more dramatic, you see, if we get to follow the operation from start to finish.'
While the group captain was digesting the idea that --- in the opinion of this alarming young man --- the airfield's operations needed to be made more 'dramatic', the other member of the film crew, who had so far said nothing, was having a look around. Rowlands only became aware of this when Forrester, who had been listening in grim silence to Macpherson's enthusiastic account of how he saw the film taking shape, suddenly barked: 'Don't touch those papers! They're confidential.'
'Sorry! Didn't mean any harm...' 
'Monty likes to get a feel for the look of the thing,' explained Macpherson; adding with a laugh, 'I'm sure he's not about to steal any top-secret documents, eh, Monty?' The script-writer agreed that this was so; adding that he'd envisaged the opening scene as what he called a 'two-hander', with the group captain talking to the squadron leader about the planned mission. 'Gets us into the action right away, see?Then we move into a set-piece in the Operations Room, with the crews getting their instructions for the night's raid.'
'That's all very well,' said Forrester impatiently. 'But I'll remind you that this is a working office, not a film set, and that the documents on my desk aren't just props. The fact is...' He broke off, perhaps struck by something the other had just said. 'You're not suggesting that I might have to act in this thing, are you?'
There was a startled pause. 'Well,' said Sandy Macpherson at last. 'That was rather the idea. I want to show an RAF station at work, d'you see? So you'd be a rather important part of all that.'
'Out of the question!' snapped Forrester. 'As I've just said, this is a working airfield, under Bomber Command. I haven't time to waste, taking part in your film, Mr Macpherson. Why, at any moment I might have the Prime Minister on the telephone, wanting to know the results of last night's raid... Or... or  urgent orders coming through from the War Office. I need to be on the "qui vive" night and day.'
'Of course,' was the reply. 'And it's that sense of urgency and excitement I want to capture in "Wings Over Germany". It will be as much adventure story as public information film,' he added. 'We want to celebrate what it is the RAF actually does. The everyday heroism of our young fliers. The split-second life-or-death decisions. The camaraderie.'
'Well...'  Forrester was evidently wavering in his determination not to take part. 'Perhaps I might participate in your, er, "two-hander" if it doesn't conflict with my regular duties...'
'That's the stuff!' said Macpherson. 'We'll having you acting like a pro, in no time.'
'You want to use my office, I take it?'
'If that's all right, sir. Unless you'd rather we mocked-up another room to look like yours?'
'That would probably be best,' said Forrester. 'One never knows quite when the PM will ring...'
'Right you are, Group Captain.' Macpherson must have glanced at his watch, for he said, 'Half-past two. Only a couple of hours of daylight left. With your permission, sir, we'll do a quick tour of the site to get an idea of what's what. Perhaps take a few exterior shots. Then once we've set up in this building, we'll do a read-through of Scene One.'
'I'll say one thing for you, Mr Macpherson,' said Forrester approvingly. 'You don't waste time getting down to brass tacks.'
'Time's money in this business,' was the reply. 'All right, Monty, let's get cracking.'

### Chapter Ten ###

Rowlands was making his way back across the concourse, when he heard his name called. He waited until the other drew level with him. 'Miss Pettifor,' he said. 'What can I do for you?' 
'Mr Macpherson's got a favour to ask,' she replied in a clear, carrying voice that was, he assumed, intended to be heard by anyone in the vicinity. 'It's to do with the film... Thanks for not giving me away,' she added, sotto voce. 'As you might have guessed, I'm here in my official capacity.' 
He murmured that he'd rather thought as much.
'We can't talk now... but I'll try and find you later. I presume you're staying nearby?'
'The King's Head. It's in the village.'
'Good. I'll find you... Ah, here's Mr Macpherson now,' she added loudly, as the director came hurrying up, sounding more than a little out of breath. 'Sorry... sorry,' he wheezed. 'Terribly unfit. My lungs, you know. Ought to give up the coffin nails, but I can't seem to break the habit.'
The others waited until Macpherson had got his wind back. A lot of men had become 'lung cases' in the last show, as a result of being exposed to mustard gas, Rowlands recalled. He was surprised to find someone of the younger generation displaying much the same symptoms. But when he said as much, the young man only laughed. 'Oh, it's not that that's kept me out of the army,' he said. 'Short sight. I can't see a foot in front of my face without these glasses...'
Rowlands said that he sympathised. 'Yes, I wondered if you were blind, when I saw the dog,' said Macpherson, with the cheerful tactlessness that was evidently habitual. 'You disguise it awfully well, doesn't he, Brenda?' 
'Oh yes,' she agreed. 'You'd hardly know there was anything different about him.'
Rowlands smiled. 'Was there something you wanted to ask me?'
'There was, actually,' Macpherson replied. 'You were so awfully helpful just now, introducing Monty and me --- and Brenda here of course --- to the Big Cheese that I wondered if I might pick your brains some more? For instance, who else ought I to talk to, to get an idea of how this place works?
'I'm just a visitor, Mr Macpherson...'
'Sandy, please.'
'Sandy, then. I know as little about the running of Mildenhall as you do, I'm afraid.'
'I very much doubt that,' said the young man. 'You seemed pretty thick with the group captain just now.'
'Mr Macpherson...'
'Do call me Sandy! Look at it from my point of view. I've got a week to turn this film around. Getting the scenes set up and the camera crew in place isn't the half of it. I need someone who can give me all the gen. The lie of the land, you know.'
'Well,' began Rowlands; but at that moment his sharp ears picked up the sound of voices, as two men --- one of them known to him --- came towards them. 'You might do worse than ask Wing Commander Hawkins to help you,' he said; then, addressing the former, who had drawn near to where they were standing: 'Hi! Wing Commander! Have you got a minute?'
'Still here, Mr Rowlands?' Hawkins' tone made it clear that he wasn't entirely delighted by this fact. 'I thought by now you'd have had enough of us.'
'Yes, I'm finding it hard to tear myself away,' replied Rowlands pleasantly. 'This is Mr Macpherson, and his assistant, Miss Pettifor. Mr Macpherson's directing the film about RAF Mildenhall.'
'We're actually calling it "Millford",' put in Macpherson. 'War Office stipulation, y'know. Names have to be changed to protect the innocent, don't y'know? All very hush-hush.'
'As indeed it should be,' said Hawkins coolly. 'But I'm afraid I want nothing to do with it. Shocking waste of time, I call it --- don't you agree, Templeton?' This was the squadron leader to whom he had been talking, and to whom Rowlands now recalled having been introduced. 'I...ah... can't say as I do, Hawkins,' replied the latter. 'Think it'll buck the men up no end, to see themselves on the silver screen.'
'You can leave me out of it,' said Hawkins. 'Some of us have got work to do. Organising tonight's operation, for a start...'
'But that's exactly what I want for my film,' said Macpherson eagerly. 'Real-life action, with no frills, or fakery. Won't you at least allow me to sit in on the preparations for tonight's... er... operation, Wing Commander? I've the Group Captain's authorisation,' he added slyly. 'I know,' replied Hawkins wearily. 'You wouldn't be here if you hadn't. And I won't stand in the way of your film-making, Mr Macpherson. Just don't expect me to be a part of it. Coming, Templeton?' With that, he stalked off.
'I... I'll be with you in a minute,' said the squadron leader. Then, to Macpherson. 'I say, might I have a word? The fact is, I did a bit of acting at Oxford. Had the lead in a couple of OUDS productions. The Importance of Being Earnest and Dangerous Corner, don't y'know? So if you're looking for volunteers to be in your film, I'd be only too glad...'
'Say no more,' said Macpherson. 'I fancy my scriptwriter has a part tailor-made for you, Squadron Leader.'
'Do you really think so? Oh, that's too thrilling!'
Now that he'd discharged his promise to Macpherson of introducing him to these senior RAF officers, Rowlands felt his obligations to the young cinéaste were at an end. As for 'Brenda Pettifor' --- or whatever she called herself --- she would no doubt offer a further explanation of her presence here when she was ready... 
He recalled his intention of tracking down Walter Pryce's colleagues. Having ascertained from the stage-struck Templeton that he was headed in the right direction, he left the director with his new-found fan and began to make his way across the concourse towards the hanger where he'd first encountered Pryce. 'We came this way before, boy --- remember?' he murmured to the dog. 'We needn't stay long.' Just long enough, he thought, to find someone who'd known Pryce, and who could tell him something --- anything --- about the man.
Hadn't there been that chap with the Yorkshire accent? Binks... no, Spinks --- that was the name! He'd do as well as any other to talk to. But when he reached the open doors of the hangar, it was immediately obvious that he was out of luck. Because the great echoing space that had been so full of noise and activity the last time he'd visited it, was now silent and deserted. Wherever the workforce was to be found at present, it wasn't here. As he stood hesitating at the open door of the hangar, he heard a shout from across the vast floor. 'Oi, you! What do you think you're doing?' A man --- presumably one of the ground crew, came striding towards him. 'Members of the public ain't allowed in here,' he said. 'Nor dogs neither.'
'I'm looking for Mr Spinks,' said Rowlands. 'Do you know where I might find him?'
'Spinksie? He'll be with the rest of the crew at the dispersals --- bombing up,' was the reply. 'But you can't go there. Only authorised personnel allowed.'
'I'm working with the police,' said Rowlands, hoping this was 'authorisation' enough. 'Investigating the death of Walter Pryce. I just want a word with Mr Spinks, that's all. It shouldn't take long.'
'Well...' The man seemed to hesitate. 'I suppose it can't do any harm. I was just going there myself, as a matter of fact. Come on, I'll take you over.'
They crossed a wide stretch of grass to reach the area where the Lancasters were lined up, each being serviced by its team of 'erks' (such was the term used by Rowlands' guide, Frank Horrocks, to describe his fellow specialists --- whether fitters, electricians, radio mechanics or other technicians). As they drew nearer, the noise intensified, as aircraft were put through last-minute checks: their engines tested and propellers feathered and unfeathered, while an NCO strode from one plane to the next, shouting orders largely incomprehensible to Rowlands. 'W-William! Checked the swing mechanism in that front turret yet? Come on! Pull your finger out! We haven't got all day.'
'Watch out!' said Horrocks, as the low rumble of a tractor's engine signalled the approach of the 'bomb train' from the ammunition dump --- although Rowlands, alerted by a sudden check in Rex's progress, had already come to a halt, to let the unwieldy procession, consisting of a chain of trolleys on which the bombs were loaded, go lumbering by. 'We've just time before they start winching up,' said the aircraftman, adding, 'Looks like the usual mix of incendiaries and HE for T-Thomas.'
As a former gunner, Rowlands was familiar enough with the terminology to know that this last acronym referred to high explosives, which would be loaded in after the narrow crates of incendiaries, designed to be dropped over the target first. It would take an expert team, directed by the armourer, an hour to load each kite, said Horrocks, by which time it would be 5.30 and time for the aircrews' briefing. 'So you've just time to catch Spinksie, before he goes off for his tea...'
But when they reached T-Thomas, it struck Rowlands that he'd be lucky to make himself heard above the drone of an engine being tuned, and the shouting of voices. 'Ammo loaded?
'Check.'
'Oil and coolant temperatures OK?'
'Check.'
'Brakes operating OK? Hydraulics? Navigation lights?'
'Check. Check. Check.'
'Instruments?'
'All OK, sir.'
'Magnetos?'
'Problem, sir.'
'There would be! Always the bloody same...' The speaker --- presumably the NCO supervising the checks --- must have caught sight of Rowlands at this moment, for he broke off; then said, 'Who the hell are you?'
'I thought it'd be OK, sir, so I says...' began Horrocks.
'I didn't ask you! Although what you think gives you the right to ignore regulations, I'd like to know! I'm still waiting for an answer,' said this fierce individual, turning his attention to the interloper. 'I want to talk to Mr Spinks, if he's here,' said Rowlands. 'I didn't ask who you've come to see, I asked you to identify yourself!' cried the NCO. Like Rowlands, he had to shout, to be heard above the engine noise. 'You must know civilians aren't allowed in this area.'
'P'raps he's a Jerry spy,' said another voice. Someone else laughed. It wasn't a friendly laugh. 'The name's Frederick Rowlands. I'm assisting the police in the matter of Walter Pryce's death,' said Rowlands calmly. 'And I'm a most unlikely spy, as you'll see if you look at me more closely.'
'We've already had the ruddy police crawling all over the shop,' said the other irritably. 'How do I know you're who you say you are, anyway?'
'You don't, Mr... er...'
'Scott,' was the reply. 'Flight Sergeant Scott.'
'Well, Flight Sergeant, if you've already talked to the police, you'll know that they're trying to discover as much as possible about Pryce's movements during the last week or so. On the one occasion I met him, Pryce was with another member of the ground crew --- a Mr Spinks. If he's here, I thought perhaps he might be able to help me.'
'Hmph! I should think that'd be all right,' said Scott, in a more conciliatory tone. 'Sorry I bit your head off just now. I didn't realise...'
'Don't mention it,' said Rowlands. 
'It's just that none of us have had much sleep, these past few weeks,' said Scott. 'What with the big push coming up and... never mind. Horrocks, make yourself useful and fetch Ted Spinks. He should be somewhere about.' 
'Wilco.' The obliging Horrocks duly went in search of his workmate, and a few moments later returned, with the latter in tow. 'What's this about?' said the man Rowlands recalled from that previous encounter. Then: 'Ah remember you. Blind feller wi' dog. What d'yer want?'
'A word with you,' said Rowlands. 'It's about Walter Pryce.'
'That feller! Can't think what yer want to know about him. He's dead, ent he? And ah'm oop to my neck here. Three planes to get ready for take-off, and two of 'em with engine malfunction...'
'Please,' said Rowlands. 'It could make all the difference to the investigation into Mr Pryce's death, if you'd answer a few questions.'
'Well, ah don't know as ah can tell you anything ah haven't already told t'other feller... Inspector is he? Axed me if Wally had any gambling debts. Ah says "to have debts yer'd have to gamble, wouldn't yer? An' Wally were always that tight wi's cash..."' He snickered at his own joke. It struck Rowlands that if Spinks knew anything, he wouldn't give it up easily.
It was Scott who broke the impasse. 'You can have five minutes, Ted. I've got to get this magneto fixed before I can pass T-Thomas fit for take-off, in any case, so you won't be wanted till then.'
'Thank you, Flight Sergeant,' said Rowlands; then, to the other man: 'Is there somewhere we can go that's less noisy?'
'Back o'er there'll do,' was the laconic reply. 'Ah could do wi' a smoke.'
'Have one of mine,' said Rowlands, as, leaving the bustle of the dispersal area behind, the two men, with Rex padding along beside, crossed the grass to the deserted hangars.  
'Don't mind if ah do.' In the shelter of the big hangar, the two men lit up. 'So,' said Spinks. 'What d'yer want to know?'
'You worked with Walter Pryce...'
'Ah did that. So did plenty of others.'
'Yes, but you and he were friends.'
'Ah wouldn't say that. We used to have a drink after work sometimes. He liked his drink, did Wally.' This wasn't news to Rowlands. He tried again. 'Did he ever say anything to you, when you were having a drink together, that struck you as out of the ordinary... or... odd?'
Spinks gave a dry chuckle. 'Odd! He were an odd chap. Kept hisself to hisself. Ah'm the same,' he added. 'Don't like blather.'
'No indeed.' This was getting nowhere, thought Rowlands. 'Why d'yer want to know, anyway?' said Spinks. 'Chap's dead, ent 'ee? Makes no difference now what he did or didn't say.'
'No,' agreed Rowlands. 'But something Pryce said or did in the days leading up to his murder might provide a clue as to why he was killed.'
'Murder, is it?' said Spinks. 'All ah heard is he were found drowned. Had a drop too much and wandered into the mere.'
'Keep it under your hat,' said Rowlands, cursing himself for his incautious slip of the tongue. 'But take it from me, it was murder. Well, if you think of anything...' 
'He did say one funny thing, once,' said Spinks, in a ruminative tone. 'A bit bladdered, he were, so he'd got to talking... Said he were involved in some "special operations". Hush-hush it were. He didn't ought to be telling me about it. "More'n my life's worth," he said. 'You ought to talk to George Frost, landlord at the Crown,' he added. 'He were there that night. Happen he knows a bit more'n ah can tell you, about what Wally Pryce were like, when he were in his cups.' He finished his cigarette, pinched it out, and spat neatly on the ground at Rowlands's feet. 'He didn't try that on again wi' me,' he said. 'Knew ah wouldn't wear it. "Special operations", indeed! Lot o' blather, if you ask me.' 

The mechanic went back to his work, and Rowlands retraced his steps towards the administrative offices, wondering as he did so whether the information Spinks had divulged had brought him very much further. It was certainly conformation of what Douglas had told him. 'Special operations' sounded like the sort of thing a man engaged in petty acts of sabotage in the service of some fanatical organisation might say to dignify his activities. Rowlands supposed that what he'd learned would keep until the superintendent returned next day for the inquest. Although he might just follow up Spinks's suggestion and have a word with the landlord at the Crown. If Pryce had been shooting his mouth off, it would have been a strong motive for his elimination by anyone wanting to keep the conspiracy a secret...
Rex's warning bark and the dog's stopping dead in his tracks brought Rowlands up short, as a lorry roared past, only an arm's length away. Mulling over what he'd learned had made the blind man recklessly oblivious to his immediate surroundings. A moment later, Anne hurried up. 'Daddy, you nearly walked straight under the wheels of that truck! You weren't concentrating.'
'I wasn't,' he admitted. 'Rex had to do that for me.' He bent to pat the dog's head. 'Fortunately, he's got more sense than I have.'
'He certainly has. Airfields are dangerous places. Really, Daddy, you ought to be more careful.'
'You sound just like your mother,' he said. 'And I promise I'll take better care in future. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?'
'The Hellcat... Section Leader Henderson, I mean... said that those of us who aren't on duty tonight might have the afternoon off to watch the filming,' was the reply. 'I was coming to fetch you, to see if you wanted to get a bite to eat beforehand. I know it's early, but I'm ravenous. What with all that business with the police earlier, I missed lunch.'
'Then we must certainly get you something to eat,' said her father. 
Early as it was --- not yet five o'clock --- it seemed that they were not the only ones with this idea. As they entered the canteen, they were met by a roaring of voices and a clatter of knives and forks on plates, together with a pervasive smell of cigarettes and institutional food, as a hundred or so of RAF Mildenhall's denizens took the edge off their appetites. 'Bother,' said Anne. 'It's fuller than I expected. We might struggle to find a seat... Oh, there's a place, next to Jean... Budge up,' she said to her friend, seating herself on a bench next to one of the trestle tables with which the canteen was furnished. 'There's space for you here, too, Daddy.' He took it, having settled Rex in a convenient spot under the table. 	
'Jean, you've met my father, haven't you?'
'I have,' said Miss Underhill drily. 'Mavis, Betty --- this is my dad,' Anne went on. 'He's staying at Mildenhall for a couple of days.'
'You're the detective,' said Mavis or Betty. 
Rowlands smiled. He wasn't about to contradict whatever Anne had told her friends about his activities. 'I've worked with the police on a number of occasions,' he said. 'I suppose you're in on this awful business with Wally Pryce?' said the girl who'd just spoken. 'They're saying it's murder.'
'Betty! We don't know that for a fact,' said Mavis. 'It might have been an accident...'
'Ken Summerson was part of the search party that brought the body back to the airfield, and he says it was definitely murder,' retorted Betty. 'You were there, too, weren't you?' she said to Anne. 'Yes. And I'd rather not discuss it, thanks. What'll you have?' said Anne to her father. 'There's soup --- leek and potato --- sausage and mash, corned beef, or beans on toast.'
'Soup for me please,' said her father. 'And a slice of bread and butter.'
'Right you are.' Anne disappeared on this errand, leaving Rowlands at the mercy of her three friends. 'Ken said,' murmured the irrepressible Betty, 'that it wasn't Mr Pryce they were looking for at all, but that other chap. The Polish one. Jan something-or-other...'
'I don't know about that,' said Rowlands, determined not to be drawn on this topic. 'But I'm sure the police are looking into every possibility.'
'Yes, but...'
'Shut up, Hicks,' said Jean Underhill sharply. 'You heard what Mr Rowlands said. The police are dealing with it. That's all we need to know. Gracious, this apple crumble's like concrete. I don't know what they put in it. Wallpaper paste, most likely.' 
'Have some custard, said Mavis. 'It helps it to go down.'
'Well, I think we have a right to know what's going on,' said Betty Hicks stubbornly. 'I mean two murders in the space of a month. Mildenhall's not safe, it seems to me.'
'Oh, boil your head, Betty.'
Just then, Anne returned with the soup, and the others fell silent, so the the voices of those further down the long table could be heard:
'... still pretty cloudy. But no fog, thank the Lord...'
'Think it'll clear?'
'Depends. Moon's full though.'
'Yes, a lovely Bomber's Moon for us tonight! Hope we get a good target...'
'What? And miss your chance for a shot at immortality?'
'Hell's that mean?'
'It means getting your ugly mug up on screen at the local picture palace. Haven't you heard that D-Donald's crew's been co-opted into this filming lark?'
There was a burst of mocking laughter. 'Typical of our Rupert to seize the limelight!'
'Hardly surprising, with those matinée idol looks...'
'Come on, or we'll miss all the fun...' With which the party of young men who'd been sitting at Rowlands's table got up, with a clattering of boots, and made for the exit. Hoots and catcalls from other groups of airmen at adjacent tables followed them. 'That's Reggie Raikes's crowd,' said Anne to her father. 'They're C-Charlie's crew.'
'Fancy themselves, don't they? scoffed Betty Hicks. 
'When you've survived as many missions as they have, you've a right to,' said Jean. 'Can I get anyone a cup of tea? I wouldn't advise the coffee.'
'I'll skip, it thanks,' said Anne. 'We want to get a ringside seat for the filming, don't we, Daddy?' 

When he came to look back on this period, it struck Rowlands as rather incongruous that it was only through the artificial medium of cinema that he learned what actually went on at Mildenhall airfield --- or indeed, at any of the hundreds of airfields, large and small, with which East Anglia was littered. Oh, he knew a bit about aeroplanes and the way they were used in warfare, from his days as a field gunner during the last conflict. Then, the batteries had relied upon the intelligence the pilots gleaned from their dangerous low-flying sorties over hostile territory to be able to target the enemy with any accuracy. In those days, now twenty years past, the young fliers in their sheepskin-lined leather jackets and leather helmets had been an élite corps, handling their machines as if these flimsy-looking constructions of wood and canvas were oversized toys.
Now, another generation of young men --- some of them no older than nineteen or twenty --- were in charge of giant aircraft, such as the 'Lanc' that the group captain had described to Rowlands in such detail on the day they'd been to interview Wally Pryce. Of course these enormous machines required a crew of seven to fly them, unlike the single- or two-seater aircraft of the earlier war (or indeed fighter planes like the Spitfire) he reminded himself. So many things were different now. Only the youth of the pilots was the same.
Entering the building where the administrative offices were, and where he had introduced Sandy Macpherson to the group captain a few hours before, Rowlands and Anne, with Rex at their heels, found themselves in the middle of a large crowd. This, as far as Rowlands could ascertain, consisted of the film crew --- perhaps twenty people in all --- plus a great many more service personnel, all talking at the tops of their voices. Cumbersome lighting and sound equipment and cameras on tripods further reduced the available space, so that it was difficult to move without tripping over something --- or someone. 'Sorry, sorry --- it's no go, I'm afraid,' shouted Macpherson, over the general din. 'I can't have this scrum in here. Only principals, please. That's you, Group Captain, and the squadron leader. The rest of you can wait in the Operations Room. Only don't get in the way of my people, while they're setting up. We've little enough time, as it is.' 
His eye must have fallen upon Rowlands at that moment, for he said, in a quieter voice, 'I'd like you to stay, Fred. The dog, too. I've an idea about how to use him... But who's this?'
'My daughter, Aircraftwoman Rowlands,' said her father. 'She's acting as my guide to Mildenhall.'
'Oh, let her stay, too. It's be good to have a few female faces to break up the monotony. She can be answering telephones, or some such. All right,' said Macpherson, once the 'scrum' had been cleared out, and the two principal actors (although playing themselves) had been given their lines, and seated on either side of a desk. 'Let's run through it from the top, shall we?'

### Chapter Eleven ###

'All right, Squadron Leader, you know what you've got to say,' said Macpherson. 'We've been over this bit often enough.'
'Right-ho,' was the cheerful reply. 'Just give me the word.'
'And... action!'
With which Templeton, evidently relishing the chance to display his thespian skills, pronounced his first line: 'Jolly good photographs these. You can see the target clearly. Get me the Commander-in-Chief, will you, Harrison?'
'Yes, sir,' said the subordinate who'd been delegated to reply.
Templeton must then have picked up the phone, for a moment later he said, 'Hello, sir... We've got the photographs from Intelligence... They show the target large as life and twice as ugly... Oh, damn. Sorry! I forgot we'd changed that line.'
'Cut,' said  Macpherson patiently. 'Take it again from, "Hello, sir." And try not to leave such long pauses between sentences, Squadron Leader. When we've spliced in the other side of the telephone conversation, it'll be apparent who's speaking at any given time.'
'Yes. Sorry,' said Templeton.
'And... action!'
'Hello, sir. We've got those photographs from Intelligence...'
As the little scene unfolded, Rowlands let his attention drift back to the time, now ten years before, when he too had played a small part in a film. That had been at the Babelsberg Studios, outside Berlin, in '33. Things had been building up, during that turbulent time, to what had turned into the present conflict --- although no one, himself included, had known how bad it was going to get. War --- and the preparations for war. These had formed the background to his entire adult life. When it would end was anybody's guess...
'And... cut!' said Sandy Macpherson. 'Well done, everybody. We'll print that. Now, before we move into the Ops Room for the group scenes, I've a question for you, Fred. Ever done any acting?'
'Well...'
'He was in a film, in Germany, once,' piped up Anne.
'It was a long time ago.'
'I should imagine it was,' laughed Macpherson. 'The only films coming out of Germany these days are those approved by Dr Goebbels.' Which had already been the case when Rowlands was in Berlin, he thought, but did not say. 'So what did you want to talk to me about?'
'It's just this,' was the reply. 'I'm short one man. A wing commander, to be precise. And nothing I can say will persuade him --- Wing Commander Hawkins, that is --- to change his mind about taking part. It'll ruin the film, you see,' went on the young director, when Rowlands said nothing. 'Because his is an important role. If we're going to show how the chain of command works --- and the Ministry was very clear about that --- we have to have him, don't you see?'
'He addresses the men before they set off on their mission,' put in Morgan, the scriptwriter. 'I've got it all written down.'
'Oh, it's not a big part,' interjected Macpherson. 'You needn't worry about that! Only a single speech, isn't it, Monty? But an important one...'
'Very important,' echoed Morgan.
'He rallies the troops you see. Gives 'em a bit of the old Dunkirk spirit... And so I thought,' went on Macpherson, 'that as I can't persuade the real wing commander to deliver the speech to camera, you might agree to stand in for him, Fred.'
'Out of the question.' 
'You've got to do it, Daddy,' said Anne at the same moment. 
'I wouldn't dream of impersonating Wing Commander Hawkins,' said Rowlands firmly. 'I'm too old, for one thing.'
'We need a senior man,' said Macpherson. 'And you're the right build and bearing to look convincing in the part. More than that,' he went on, 'you've got a good clear speaking voice. As I said, it's only a single speech, but I'm confident that you'll be able to do it. You've had military experience, haven't you?'
'I was never an officer,' said Rowlands. 'The men will laugh when they see an old buffer pretending to be one of them.' 
'They'll do nothing of the kind. They're all much too keyed-up about appearing in the film themselves to give a thought to anyone else.'
'Oh Daddy, you must do it.' 
'You seem to forget that, quite apart from my age, I don't have a uniform.' Rowlands was weakening, and he knew it. 'Ah, we've thought of that,' said Macpherson. 'I took the liberty of asking Group Captain Forrester if he could order you up a spare uniform, with all the right "scrambled egg" on the tunic. I think you'll look very distinguished in it, Fred --- or should I say, "Wing Commander"?' 
Persuaded by the combined efforts of Macpherson and Anne, Rowlands found himself donning a British uniform for the first time since 1917. It wasn't of course the one he'd worn all those years ago --- the famous blue-grey cloth from which the RAF uniforms were made hadn't been introduced until the last year of the war, so he had no visual memory of it. But the smooth feel of the woollen cloth under his hands brought back memories, even though the cut of the belted tunic, with its 'wings' over the left breast pocket, its three stripes on the sleeve and its row of brass buttons down the front, was of an unfamiliar type. The trousers, with their knife-sharp creases, were just the right length, so that at least he wouldn't look as much of a fraud as he felt. 'Don't be silly, Daddy,' said Anne, when he voiced this feeling. 'You're supporting the war effort by appearing in this film. You heard what Sandy said --- it's all about keeping up morale.'
So it was 'Sandy' now, was it? he thought. 'All right, you've convinced me,' he said. 'Now help me with this tie, will you? And then we'd better go over my speech once more.'
'Better put your cap on first,' said his daughter. 'Here. Let me.' She accordingly placed the cap, with its RAF badge and gold braided peak, squarely on his head. 'There! You look just the part. All you need is a "handlebar" moustache to complete the picture.'
'Fortunately, there isn't time to grow one. Now, about that speech...'
In the end, it wasn't as bad as he'd feared. The worst moment was when he entered the 'Ops Room' for the first time. Had he imagined the brief silence that fell over the waiting crowd, as their newly-appointed 'wing commander' walked in? He wondered what explanation the young men and women assembled there had been given for Hawkins's non-appearance. He was glad that Anne was at his side --- and Rex, too --- to guide him onto the platform, where canvas folding chairs had been set out for the 'top brass', of which he was one, temporarily, he supposed. 
Macpherson had insisted that Rex should be included in the scene --- even though it seemed irregular to Rowlands. 'It'll humanise you,' the young man said. 'People like dogs, as I said.' Certainly Rex received his share of attention from the crowd that filled the room to capacity.
'Nice doggie... Here, boy!'
'Shh --- you'll unsettle him.'
'Not he! Look at him --- eyes front, like a little soldier.'
As Rowlands took his seat, they were still filming the sequence in which the crews discover from the chalked-up names on the board at the far end of the room which of the planes in their squadron was scheduled to fly that night.
'Looks like N for Nuts is washed out...'
'C for Charlie's there... And R for Robert.'
'You chaps get all the luck. I haven't been off the ground for a week!'
Then came the squadron leader's instruction to the crews about the night's target. This was to be the oil storage unit at Freihausen, in the Black Forest. Templeton was doing a good job of describing the features of this  --- with reference, Rowlands gathered, to a large-scale photograph of the area that was pinned up on the wall behind where he and the other RAF officers sat. It occurred to him as he listened to the young man's confident delivery, that issuing orders to the bombing crews was doubtless something Templeton did every day. He'd hardly needed the acting experience of which he'd boasted.
'F for Freddie, you'll want to begin your bombing run here... just where the canal takes a turn to the north... then strike these concrete installations in the wood... here. C for Charlie, you need to hit these railway sidings to the east of the wood, here. R for Robert, you'll be knocking out the oil storage tanks along the canal here. You'll need to stay around long enough to take your photographs, remember? Don't forget to pick up your target maps. Over to you, Wing Commander.'
The moment he'd been dreading had come. Rowlands stood up, adjusted his cap, and took a deep breath. 'All right, you men,' he said. His voice sounded strange to him, booming out in the silence; but nobody laughed, and nobody shouted 'cut'. 'You've heard all about the target for tonight, and it's a good one. Your job is to find it and destroy it.' He paused a moment, because it was important not to gabble, but to speak slowly and with emphasis. He'd been on the receiving end of speeches like this during his days in the army. You hung on every word ---  as the men he was addressing were doing now. There must have been fifty or sixty people in the room and yet you could have heard a pin drop. Only the smell of cigarette smoke told him he was not alone.
'I know you can do it, because you're all experienced men,' he went on. 'You'll need to drop your bombs, take your pictures, and get out of there, as soon as you can. But a word of warning. As soon as the enemy knows you've found the target, you'll get flak. It'll be light at first, but it'll get heavier --- so be prepared. You've all got your orders, and you all know what to do when you reach the target. Go in and flatten it. And good luck to you.'
Well, it was hardly the speech before Agincourt, but it seemed to go down all right. 'And... cut!' said Sandy Macpherson. 'Well done, everybody. We'll print that.'
During the interval that followed, Rowlands went to change out of his uniform, feeling that he'd had enough of this acting lark for one night. 'You needn't think you'll be hanging up your wings just yet, Fred,' said Macpherson, when he'd handed back the tunic, trousers and cap. 'I might need you for a final shot --- with Rex of course --- at the end of the film.'
'All right --- just as long as I haven't any more lines to say.'
'Oh, you did very well. Told you you were a natural,' said the director. 'Norman! Can we get these lights set up for the night sequences as soon as possible? I want some footage of the planes outside the hangars, as soon as we've shot the interior scene.'
This was another group sequence, involving the crews of the three planes featured in the film (which was as many as could be spared from the night's real missions, Macpherson explained). Thus it was that twenty-one young men were filmed getting kitted-out for the Freihausen raid, in their flying suits, sheepskin-lined jackets, helmets and boots. A certain amount of --- slightly laboured --- humour characterised these exchanges between one man and the next, which were, by and large, improvised rather than scripted. 'I just told 'em to say the kind of things they'd say to one another when getting ready for a mission,' said the director. 'Said they should keep it clean, though. Family viewing and all that.'
So: 'I'm missing a party for this, worst luck,' said one young spark, pulling on his overalls. 'You've saved yourself a sore head, then,' was his friend's sarcastic reply. 'Hey!' --- as a boot was thrown at him --- 'Mind my head. I've only got the one.' 
Beneath these determinedly cheery remarks, scattered with the by-now familiar airforce slang --- 'Pull your finger out!' 'What's the "gen"?' 'You're looking a bit brassed-off, old man...' --- Rowlands thought he detected a barely suppressed unease. Because, whether tonight's exercise was for real or not, these young fellows knew only too well what might be in store for some --- if not all --- of them, one day. All their facetious talk couldn't conceal the fact that their chances of being shot down were great, and their chances of survival slim. Six weeks was the life expectancy for many of these young men, during that terrible year of 1943; six months if you were lucky. The casual flippancy with which they referred to the likelihood of finding themselves 'in a spot of bother', of being forced to 'ditch' or 'bail', only served to underline the horror of the reality.
The word 'death' was never mentioned. Men 'went for a Burton' or 'bought it'. Their grim name for an ambulance --- 'meat wagon' --- showed how clearly they knew what was what. All that youth and health and strength reduced to so much charred and bleeding flesh, in the blink of an eye.
Rowlands observed this gallant display of gallows humour for another half an hour, before deciding he'd had enough. Leaving Anne and her friends to it ('Oh Daddy, you were marvellous! Wasn't he marvellous, girls?'), he gave Rex his marching orders, and the two of them set off across the by-now deserted airfield. Somewhere, in the skies above his head, a flight of aircraft --- not the lucky ones who'd been picked for the film, but others in the same squadron --- was heading towards its target. Where exactly that was --- the French coast, or the Ruhr valley --- he could only guess. What conditions would be like, up there on this freezing cold night, with flak flying around and enemy fighters coming out of nowhere to wreak their lethal damage on any Lancasters unfortunate enough to have strayed within range, were other things at which his imagination baulked.  
It was gone nine when he and Rex reached the gate. They'd be back at the pub at a quarter-past. Time for a quick pint and then turn in early, he thought. Tomorrow would be another long day. The inquest was at eleven. He hoped, despite what he'd said, that Douglas wouldn't feel the need to call Anne.
As he said goodnight to the sentry (they were getting to know him by now), a vehicle, which had been idling its engine at the side of the road, pulled out and drove slowly along the road down which he too was heading, and then came to a halt once more. Almost before he could ask himself what this curious procedure might mean, two men jumped out, and he found himself bundled him into the back of the vehicle. A jeep, he surmised, from the rudimentary seating, and the fact that it was open at the sides. Rex, barking furiously, was bundled in afterwards.
'What the hell?'
But to Rowlands's angry question there was no answer. Only a muffled expletive, as Rex, indigent at the treatment he and his master were receiving, sank his teeth into one of the assailants' legs. The outburst told Rowlands all he needed to know. These men ---he guessed there were four of them, including the driver of the vehicle --- were Polish. 'Where are you taking me?' he said. 'Be quiet, Rex,' he added, because the dog was still barking his head off. Then, as the animal's growls subsided, Rowlands tried again: 'This isn't Nazi Germany, where people can be kidnapped in the street. So if it's all the same to you, I'd like to know who you are, and where you're taking me.'
There was a moment's startled silence; then one of his captors --- the one sitting next to the driver --- laughed. 'You are right. My apologies for "kidnapping" you, as you say. But there was no other way. My name is Czarnecki.'
'I believe we have spoken before. On the telephone.'
'We have. As to where we are going, I am afraid I cannot tell you, for reasons of security.' But Rowlands now had a pretty good idea where they were going. 
They drove for another twenty minutes or so before the jeep slowed to a halt in front of what Rowlands guessed were the gates of Audley End House --- otherwise known as Station 43. A password was given and the jeep passed through the gates and onto the drive, which was as full of potholes as he remembered from that earlier visit, when his daughter and the wing commander had been with him. Instead of pulling up in front of the house, as it had on that first occasion, the vehicle followed the gravel drive around to the back. Once the jeep was parked in what Rowlands assumed must be the old stables, Czarnecki said brusquely, 'We get out now. Do not speak. And keep the dog quiet. We go in here.'
This turned out to be a side-entrance --- perhaps a door into the kitchen quarters, to judge from the lingering smells of institutional food. 'This way,' said Czarnecki, nudging Rowlands in the back. 'Keep absolutely quiet, if you please.' The five men, with Czarnecki in the lead, climbed a flight of creaking wooden stairs --- meant for servants, no doubt, thought Rowlands. These big houses were built to ensure that the people who owned them and those who served the owners had as little to do with each other as possible, given that the former depended on the latter to keep the fires burning, the baths hot, the rooms swept, and the meals on the table. 
At the top of the stairs, Czarnecki prodded his 'guest' again. 'This way.' They went along a linoleum floored corridor, and reached another flight of stairs. Here, Czarnecki muttered a few words in Polish to his companions, the upshot of which was that the three of them were to remain behind. Then he and Rowlands, with Rex padding along beside, climbed the stairs leading to what was evidently some kind of attic.
It was a large room, stretching perhaps the width of the building, Rowlands guessed, from the hollow echo of their footsteps on the wooden floor, and the volume of air above their heads. There was a strong, but not unpleasant, smell of coal dust. Someone came towards him. 'Mr Rowlands, I presume?' said a warm, only slightly accented voice. 'I am happy to meet you, at last.'
'Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz?' said Rowlands, hoping he had pronounced the name correctly. 'The same. And this must be the estimable Rex. I have heard much of Rex's good qualities from Anne.' Rowlands smiled. No doubt he would learn what all this was about in due course. An exchange in Polish followed, at the end of which Wawrzkowicz said: 'I must apologise for the unorthodox method by which you were brought here. Although I understand from Captain Czarnecki that Rex here did his best to defend you against your abductors.'
'I hope your man was not too badly hurt,' said Rowlands politely. Wawrzkowicz laughed. 'Oh, no doubt he will bear the scars of Rex's heroic resistance,' he said. 'But let us sit down. Cigarette?'
Rowlands said that he would smoke his own, thanks. 'A wise choice,' said the Polish officer. 'Would you care for some tea --- or other refreshment?'
'Tea will be fine.'
'Tea it is.' Another brief exchange ensued between the two Poles, after which Czarnecki left them. 'You are of course wondering,' said Wawrzkowicz, as the two men lit up, 'why I brought you here.'
'Well, yes.'
'I would be very surprised if you were not!' laughed the young man. 'And since you have been searching for me all this time, I thought it only right that you should find me.'
'I assume,' said Rowlands, 'that no one but ourselves --- and the men I've already had dealings with --- knows you are here?'
'You are correct. It is a good trick, is it not --- to hide in a place which has already been searched from top to bottom?'
Rowlands agreed that it was.
'I have hidden in coal cellars before now,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'But not in an attic full of coal! It is a peculiarity of this house to store the coal for the fires at the top, rather than at the bottom, of the building. Supposedly,' he added, 'to make it easier for the maidservants to carry the heavy coal scuttles. Down, rather than up, you see...'
'Were you ever at Wicken Fen?' interrupted Rowlands. 
'Oh, yes. I held out there for almost two weeks. It was not as warm as this, I can assure you. But it became too "hot" for me, nonetheless.'
'So Anne was right --- that you were hiding out at the brick kilns?'
'Anne is right about a great many things. She knows I did not murder Jonny Bly, for one. It is true we had a disagreement --- he was angry with me for taking Anne away from him, as he saw it --- but I did not kill him. I have killed men, you understand? But never an unarmed man, and never without reason. I did not kill this man Pryce, either --- although there I would have been justified,' said the Polish fighter grimly. Rowlands remembered something that had puzzled him at the time. The Enfield Mk 2 revolver which which Bly had been shot. 'Can I ask you a couple of questions?'
'Ask away.'
'What make of gun do you use?'
Wawrzkowicz laughed. 'That's easy! The one favoured by all of us in the Polish army --- a VIS Wzor Pistolet. They are light, compact and generally reliable. Why do you want to know this?' Then, before Rowlands could answer, the other laughed. 'I assume that that was not the kind of gun with which poor Mr Bly was shot?'
'It was not. One other question: when and where did you mislay your cigarette case?'
'It was confiscated with my other possessions --- identity card, watch, belt --- when I was arrested by the military police at Mildenhall. I should very much like these things back --- especially the cigarette case. It was a gift, you know...' Suddenly, he gave a hiss, cautioning the other to silence, as there came a creak of a footstep on the stair. But it was only one of his comrades, arriving with the tea. 'This is the fellow who was foolish enough to make an enemy of your dog,' said Wawrzkowicz, as he handed Rowlands a tin mug full of the piping hot beverage. 'Fortunately, he has a thick skin.'
The man (Rowlands wondered if it was one of those he had met before --- Osmecki or Weitjo) laughed at this, and left them. Then Wawrzkowicz picked up his thread once more. 'I did not bring you here to tell you that I am innocent of the crimes we have been discussing, Mr Rowlands. Nor to say that you have a remarkable daughter --- although both these things are true. I hear,' he went on, 'that you have been asking questions about Walter Pryce at the airfield?' 
'Yes. What of it?'
'Only that it is dangerous to ask such questions. There is something going on at Mildenhall I do not like. People who get caught up in this sometimes end up dead. I do not want this to happen to you, Mr Rowlands, both because I like you, and because it would distress Anne. Do you understand?'
'I already know that Pryce was involved with National Resurgence,' said Rowlands. 'I take it that is what you mean by "something going on"?' 
'Ah, your policeman friend has told you of this! Yes, it is what I mean. Pryce, as you say, was one of a group of malcontents and traitors trying to undermine the war effort... but there is more to it than that.' Wawrzkowicz was silent a moment. 'I am going to tell you something you must not repeat to anyone else. Not your policeman, and not even Anne. Do I have your word on this?'
After a moment's thought, Rowlands gave it.
'Here at Station 43, we are engaged in a number of missions --- the details of which need not concern you. We have been flying our men --- and some women, it may surprise you to know --- from an airfield not far from here, across Occupied Europe. They are then dropped by parachute into enemy territory, in order to carry out various tasks. For some, this is merely to blend in with the local populace, and to send radio messages back as to the likelihood, or otherwise, of establishing resistance cells. For others, it is action of, shall we say, a more immediate kind that is required. Again, I need not go into details,'
And it was not difficult to imagine what the 'immediate action' might entail, thought Rowlands. Not for nothing were these people trained in the art of killing. What was it they called themselves? 'Silent and unseen'. Yes, he could very well envisage the kind of things they were required to do...
'These are dangerous missions,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'Our people know this, when they volunteer to undertake them. They are brave people, Mr Rowlands. They are happy to risk their lives in the service of our poor country.' Again, he paused, as if trying to think how best to say what he had to say. 'I tell you this to show that death --- violent death --- is not unknown to our organisation. Every time one of us sets off on a mission, we know that there is a chance we might not return. Nor will our deaths necessarily be swift or merciful deaths.' He gave a grim little laugh. 'The enemy is skilled, when it comes to inflicting pain on a captured fighter.'  Another pause --- this time so long that Rowlands wondered if the other man had forgotten he was there.
'The fact is, Mr Rowlands,' Wawrzkowicz said at last. 'There have been too many deaths of late. Deaths that could not be explained away, by a moment's carelessness, or through simple bad luck --- a message intercepted, or a conversation overheard. These are the reasons why our agents have been captured, tortured and shot, during the past few years. Only recently ---- that is to say, within the last five or six months --- the number of agents captured and killed has risen greatly.'
'You think someone is betraying them?'
'I know it. What I do not yet know is who,' said Wawrzkowicz. 
'And you think that this person --- or persons --- is connected to RAF Mildenhall?'
'I do not know. But there are some bad things going on there --- that I do know.'
It was a near-echo of Jonathan Bly's words to Anne, thought Rowlands. 'Do you think Walter Pryce was part of this conspiracy?' he said.
'It seems very likely,' the other replied. 'No doubt he was killed because he had proved unreliable. The man was a drinker, who boasted of his activities, I understand.'
'And Jonny Bly? Was he, too, involved in all this?'
'Bly knew something, that is certain,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'But how deeply he was involved, I do not know. The fact that he was killed would suggest that he had become a danger to somebody else. That is why I am afraid for you, Mr Rowlands. These people will not scruple to kill when someone gets in their way. Even a detective as renowned as you are would not be wise to cross them.' He must have seen Rowlands's pained expression, for he added, 'Oh, your reputation precedes you...'
'Anne, I suppose.'
'Not only Anne. Although she is understandably proud of her father's achievements. You are working with that police detective, are you not? Word of that will have reached others, apart from myself. Be careful, Mr Rowlands.'


### Chapter Twelve ###

The jeep dropped him back at the King's Head at a few minutes to midnight; fortunately Catchpole had only just turned in and so hadn't been asleep when Rowlands knocked. 'There were a young lady asking for you earlier,' he said. 'From the film company, she said she was. Said you'd know all about it.'
'Yes' said Rowlands. So 'Brenda Pettifor' had been as good as her word. A pity he'd missed her --- but he guessed she'd make another attempt to see him. She was a determined young woman... 'Didn't know as there was filming going on at Mildenhall,' said Catchpole, adding with a chuckle, 'It's a long way from Hollywood, this.'
'Indeed it is,' said Rowlands. 'Sorry if you've been kept up, Mr Catchpole. Tomorrow morning would have done to give me the message, you know.' 
'Oh, 'twas no trouble, sir,' said the other. 'Sat up doin' my accounts, I were. 'The missus said to leave it, but I like to get things straight at the turn o' the month.'
Rowlands said that sounded very sensible to him --- apologising once more for having disturbed the household. 'Oh, I never sleep well o' nights,' said the landlord. 'Not wi' them planes goin' o'er. I says to Nellie, I says, "Wonder if any of 'em's flyin' o'er where our Tom is lyin'..."' The couple's son, it transpired, was a prisoner of war, 'somewhere in Germany'. They'd had letters from him after he was first captured, but nothing now for several weeks. They'd sent parcels through the Red Cross, but didn't know if he'd received the last one. 'I'm sorry,' said Rowlands; because there was nothing else one could say. He hoped that wherever he was the lad was all right.
Lying awake under the sloping ceiling (he'd managed to bang his head more than once --- his height being a disadvantage in a dwelling with such low ceilings) he thought about what he'd learned from his meeting with Jan Wawrzkowicz. That there was a traitor at Mildenhall he already knew from Douglas. That the information being leaked to the enemy by this shadowy figure was seriously undermining the resistance movement was a new, and sinister, twist. 'Men are being dropped over France, Belgium and Holland --- and walking straight into Boche patrols. It is as if they are waiting for us,' Wawrzkowicz had said, in a voice cold with anger.
As he was taking his leave of the young man, he thought to ask how the latter and Anne had met. 'That's easy,' Wawrzkowicz had replied, his good humour now restored. 'I was collecting a plane from the airfield --- a Wellington, as it happens. Anne was dealing with the paperwork. There was a lot of paperwork. The RAF does not lend its aircraft lightly! We... that is, Anne and I... got talking.'
'I see.'
That would have been that, as far as Rowlands was concerned. His daughter's love life was her own business. But then Wawrzkowicz added fiercely, 'I would never endanger her, you must believe that! That is why I have not tried to see her since my escape from Mildenhall.'
'I appreciate that.'
'She matters too much to me, you understand? If anything were to happen to her on my account, I would never forgive myself.'

The inquest on Walter Pryce was a fairly perfunctory affair. Rowlands gave his evidence, as did Hawkins. Anne, too, was called, but to her father's relief wasn't asked to go into detail about her experience of finding the body, other than to confirm that she had not recognised the dead man ('I'd never met Mr Pryce...'), which she did without faltering. On the matter of the cigarette case, she had sounded more hesitant. Yes, she rather thought it was Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz's case... or one very like it. No, she had not seen it lying near the body of Mr Pryce... but, yes, it was possible she had overlooked it.
'I've only made things worse for Jan,' she said afterwards to her father. 'I know the cigarette case wasn't there that day. It wasn't! But who's going to believe me?'
'I believe you,' said her father, knowing it was small comfort, if the police did not.
'All verrae neat and tidy,' observed the superintendent, who had returned from London for the inquest. Because after the medical evidence as to the cause and probably time of death had been supplied by the doctor, the coroner had accepted the police request for an adjournment. 'We'll let the guid Inspector Strong pursue his lines of enquiry, while we follow our own leads. Want to join me, Fred --- or have ye something better to do?'
Rowlands said that as his train back to Brighton wasn't until that afternoon he'd accompany Douglas on whatever excursion he had in mind. He was still thinking about his conversation with Wawrzkowicz. He had given his word not to divulge what the resistance fighter had told him about the probable links between the National Resurgence conspiracy and the betrayal of Polish agents --- yet surely this information was of vital importance, if they were to catch the man (or men) who'd murdered Bly and Pryce?
He was still wondering how to resolve this dilemma without giving away Wawrzkowicz's whereabouts, when Douglas said to the driver of the police car, 'All right, Dennison, pull in here. Third cottage in the row...' Then, as the Wolseley came to a stop, the superintendent exclaimed under his breath, 'What's she doing here? As if I didn't know! Anyone would think they didn't trust me to do my job...'
Who 'they' were, wasn't hard to guess. 'Hello, gentlemen,' said voice Rowlands knew. 'It seems we've had the same idea.'
'Hello, Miss. Thought you were meant to be with the film crew,' said Douglas, sounding distinctly disgruntled. 'Oh, I am,' said Brenda Pettifor. 'But they can manage without me for an hour or so. Such a lovely afternoon for a bike ride! And it'll give me a chance to catch up with the investigation, Superintendent. I take it the inquest was adjourned, as we expected?'
'Aye.'
'Good. Then let's go in, shall we? We don't want to keep Mrs Cooper waiting.'   
This, it turned out, was the late Walter Pryce's landlady. Yes, said the little old woman thus named, in the distinctive accent of the region. She'd 'done' for Mister Pryce for sometime now. Must be two years, come Whitsuntide. 'Quoi-et gennelman, he wor. Et his brekfuss reg'lar at se'en o'clock, an' that wor last yew saw of 'en till late. Loiked his drop, but then oi doan know a man that doan,' she added with a creaking laugh. 'Doan know what yew'll foind that t'other feller di'n',' she added, as Miss Pettifor, followed by the two men, climbed the ladder-like stairs to the upper floor of the cottage. 'Great lummox he wor, tramplin' about. An' t'other one afore 'en.'
'That sounds like friend Strong,' grunted Douglas. 'Good man, but inclined to go blundering in...' Something the old woman had said appeared to arrest his attention, for he stopped half-way up the stairs. 'What do you mean, "the other one"?'
'Loike I says. Gennelman came by, two, mebbe three, noights ago. Sed 'ee was from th'airfield. He di'n' trample about. Quoi-et as a cat, he wor...'
'Hmm,' said Brenda Pettifor. 'It would appear that someone's been here ahead of us. Well, might as well take a look, now we're here.' 	
There were two rooms, both with an old-fashioned latch on the door. 'The front bedroom, I fancy,' said the superintendent, having poked his head into both. 'Anyone over six foot needs to watch his head.' With his experience of the low ceilings at the King's Head all too fresh in his mind, Rowlands obediently ducked. The room was small, with a brass bedstead --- into which he blundered --- occupying most of the space. A faint smell of mothballs hung in the air. 'So,' said Douglas. 'What have we got? Bed. Chest of drawers, with jug and basin. Table, cane-bottomed chair, half-size wardrobe. All of it clean and tidy,' he concluded. 'But what can it tell us about Walter Pryce?'
The answer was: not much. The superintendent turned his attention to the wardrobe. 'Item: one suit, cheap quality. Two shirts. In the drawer, socks and underwear. No personal possessions apart from a comb and safety razor. I'll say this for him, Inspector Strong has done a thorough job.' Even the fireplace had been swept clean, no doubt by the efficient Mrs Cooper, and so there was nothing but a trace of ash to suggest that anything apart from coals had been burnt there.
On the table was a pile of books. Miss Pettifor, who had left the rest of the search up to her Special Branch colleague, read the titles of these aloud. 'An Introduction to Aeronautical Engineering by J D Haddon... An Elementary Course in the Construction of Aircraft by A C Kermode... The rest are technical journals.' She shook them all, but no letters or other documents fell out. Meanwhile Douglas searched under the mattress, and lifted the rag rug, with the same result. 'If there was ever anything here, it isnae here now,' he said in resigned tone. 'I reckon whoever searched this room before our man Strong made certain o' that.'
But Rowlands, who had played no part in searching the room until now, remembered something from a long time ago --- when the woman who was now calling herself Brenda Pettifor was known as Iris Barnes. It had been she who'd been with him on the night train from Berlin to Paris that time. Also with them had been a boy --- his nephew Billy --- who had been carrying a satchel. In the satchel had been a framed photograph of a famous film star. Behind the photograph, had been a list of names...
'Are there any pictures on the wall?' he asked. 'Aye, just the one,' replied Douglas. 'But I've already checked behind it. The Light o' the World,' he added. 'We had that in the parlour at home.'
'Take it down, would you?'
'I told you, there's nothing there.' But the superintendent did as he was asked. 'Give it to me, will you?' The picture was a large one, in a heavy frame. Rowlands turned it over, and took the knife from his pocket. The backing of the picture was a sheet of brown paper, trimmed to fit neatly up against the edge of the frame. It had been recently done: there was still a smell of paste. Carefully, he ran the tip of his knife along one side, slitting the paper. When there was space enough for him to slide his fingers in, he did so --- withdrawing a number of folded sheets of what felt like draughtsman's paper. Douglas let out a whistle. 'Well, well,' he said. 'Shows you should never overlook what's under your nose.' 
'I'll take those,' said Miss Pettifor, or Iris Barnes, or whatever she was calling herself. She took the sheets from Rowlands, and examined them for a moment. 'As I suspected, these are technical documents. "H2S Mk II Ground-Scanning Radar", she read aloud. 'Good work, Mr Rowlands. I wonder if you know what it is you've found?'

In the car on the way back to the airfield (Sergeant Dennison having been sent back with the bicycle), the MI5 agent explained the significance of Rowlands' discovery. 'I won't go into too much detail,' she said. 'Because much of the information is Most Secret. Suffice it to say that the H2S radar system --- originally called 'Blind Navigation', it might amuse you to know, Mr Rowlands --- has been in use for the best part of a year. It's given our bomber crews a distinct advantage over the Germans, enabling navigators to produce detailed maps of specific areas below the aircraft, while actually in flight. I don't need to tell you that it's enabled the RAF to be far more accurate in bombing enemy targets.' She was silent a moment. 'Unfortunately, the H2S has now fallen into enemy hands...'
'Do you mean somebody passed the secret to the enemy?' interrupted Douglas.
'We don't think so, in this instance,' was the reply. 'What appears to have happened was that, at the beginning of last month, an H2S was captured virtually intact from a crashed aircraft. So the Germans now have the capacity to make their own version...'
'So we've lost whatever advantage we had,' said the superintendent bitterly. 'Not entirely,' said Miss Barnes. 'An improved, H2S Mark II --- of which these are the blueprints --- is already in production. It's this version that Walter Pryce was intending to sell to the highest bidder, one must suppose. Only he was killed before he could do so.'
'The question is, who killed him?' said Douglas. 'My guess would be it's someone at RAF Mildenhall. The same "someone" who did for Pryce when he got too greedy, one can assume.'
'Yes, that would be a likely assumption,' said Miss Barnes with the faintest trace of sarcasm. Rowlands knew there wasn't much love lost between the MI5 operative and his policeman friend --- nor between their respective organisations. 'Now we just have to find the man, Superintendent. You can drop me here,' she added, as the car arrived once more at the airfield. 'Time I resumed my duties as Mr Macpherson's assistant. I'll see you later, gentlemen.'  
With that, she got out of the car and walked briskly off. As the two men went to follow her, Rowlands was still thinking about what Jan Wawrzkowicz had told him. Could Pryce --- or this mysterious 'someone' to whom Douglas referred ---  have been responsible for betraying the Polish agents? For leaking the dates and times of the flights across Occupied Europe, so that by the time the agents were parachuted in, they were already dead men... And so he was hardly listening to his friend as the latter continued to enthuse about their discovery. 'Aye, that was a good piece o' detection ye did there! Don't think I'll forget this, Fred. Why, it might be the very thing that cracks the case. All we have to do it find out who Pryce was in touch with, at National Resurgence.'
'Mm,' said Rowlands. He realised that Douglas was still speaking. 'I just want a word with the group captain before I set off back to London. I can give ye a lift, if ye like?'
'Thanks. I'd appreciate that. 'I'll need to collect my bag from the pub. All right, Rex, you'll get your walk, never fear.' For the dog had raised a mild protest at having been confined to the car, for the past hour. He was a patient animal, as a rule --- but enough was enough.
'We'll have time for a sandwich, and a pint of that Suffolk beer ye're so fond of,' added Douglas. 'I think we desairve it.'
'Are you going to tell Group Captain Forrester about finding the documents?' said Rowlands. 'Not yet,' was the reply. 'There's a few matters I need to make certain of, before I put him in the picture.'
Guiltily aware that one of those matters was the whereabouts of Jan Wawrzkowicz, Rowlands said nothing to this. It occurred to him that it might prove difficult to keep this particular 'matter' to himself during the two-hour car journey back to London. Douglas knew him too well, that was the trouble. 
They arrived at the building where Forrester was to be found at that time of day. As they entered the outer office (now cleared of the paraphernalia of filming) one of the secretaries sprang up from her desk. 'I'm afraid Group Captain Forrester's got somebody with him, sir,' she said to Douglas. 'You can't see him now.'
'Och, the group captain'll see me,' said the Scotsman, making as if to pass her. 'But sir...'
'Superintendent, lassie.'
'I'm afraid you'll have to wait, Superintendent. He's given me strict instructions that he's not to be disturbed.'
Rowlands could only admire the young woman's pluck. Not many had the temerity to stand up to Alasdair Douglas. But then he heard something that drove all other thoughts from his mind. His daughter's voice, saying something he couldn't quite catch, followed by Forrester's reply. A moment later, the door of the inner office opened. 'Well, if you think that's best, sir...' Anne was saying; then, catching sight of her father: 'Daddy! Thank goodness you're here. I... I thought you'd gone.' She sounded perfectly calm, but he thought he detected a tremulous note.
'What's going on?' he said.
Before she could reply, the group captain, who had followed Anne out, said, 'You'd better come into my office, Rowlands. You too, Superintendent.' Then, when the door was closed behind the four of them: 'All right, Aircraftwoman. You'd better tell your father what's happened.'
In a curiously flat tone, Anne did as she was told. After the inquest, she'd gone straight back to her office, she said. As it happened, she was the only one there, because it was the lunch break. 'I'd a lot of work to catch up with, so I didn't bother with lunch... Are you sure you want me to say all this again, sir?'
'Yes,' said Forrester. 'Go on.'
'I... I was just getting on with some paperwork, when the telephone on my desk rang. When I answered it, a voice said, "You'll be sorry for what you've done." Then I...'
'Did you recognise the voice?' interrupted Rowlands.
'No. At least... it did sound vaguely familiar... only curiously muffled.'
'Probably a handkerchief over the mouthpiece,' put in the superintendent. 'Go on, lassie.'
'I... I was a bit shaken, but I thought it might have been a joke... someone trying to put the wind up me.' She gave a rueful laugh. 'I haven't been the most popular girl on the base since that business with Jonny. Anyway, I carried on working for a bit... it was about a quarter to two by this time... and then Sergeant Venables came in and said I might have fifteen minutes' break, before the afternoon shift. So I went back to barracks, because I was feeling peckish and I remembered I had an apple in my locker.' Her voice seemed to have got quieter, so that it was barely above a whisper. 'When I opened my locker, this was inside, wrapped up in a scrap of paper, with some writing on it. "You're Next", it says...'
'Don't touch it,' said Douglas sharply, as Rowlands reached out his hand. 'Although the lassie hersel' was careful to use a handkerchief. Not that there'll be any prints on the thing... At a glance, I'd say that was from an Enfield revolver. A bullet,' he added, in case Rowlands hadn't gathered as much. 'Nasty thing for the lassie to find.' His even tone of voice did not conceal his anger. 'I don't suppose ye've any idea who could have left it?' he said to Anne. 'Anyone who might have a grudge against ye, I mean?'
'I'm afraid I don't. The other girls are all very nice. I don't think any of them would have been so spiteful as to leave that particular calling-card in my locker. Besides which,' Anne pointed out, 'none of us have access to guns. It's only the men who get to do shooting practise. And even then, the armoury's always kept locked when not in use --- isn't it, sir?'
Forrester agreed that it was. 'But I hardly think it could have been one of the men...' he began. Anne cut across him. 'Oh, no, I didn't mean that! Even though there was a bit of a row over Jonny getting shot, I don't believe any of the fliers could have done it.'
'And yet somebody did, thought Rowlands. 'Well, whoever it was, it means you're not safe here until they're caught,' he said. 'I think you should come home for a while.'
'I've already told Aircraftwoman Rowlands to take some leave, as of now,' said the group captain. 'I want this matter cleared up as soon as possible, Superintendent. With all that's been happening at Mildenhall these past weeks, I can't take the risk that there might be something in this ugly little threat.'
'No indeed, sir,' was Douglas's reply. He turned to Rowlands. 'We can take the lassie in the car with us. Home's the safest place for her, just now.'
Anne said she needed to collect her ration-book and gas-mask, and so she and her father, accompanied as ever by the ever-watchful Rex, walked back to the barracks where, less than an hour before, she had made her disturbing discovery. 'I'd better warn you, it's quite a hike,' she said, adding in a valiant attempt at humour: 'They like to keep us as far away as possible from the men's quarters.'
'That's probably a good thing --- at least for the women,' said Rowlands, aiming for the same lighthearted tone. 'I suppose so.' Anne was silent a moment. 'Oh Daddy, it's all so horrible,' she said. 'To think that anybody should hate me that much...'
He was about to offer some words of reassurance --- although really, what was there to say? --- when a voice from across the parade ground barked, 'Aircraftwoman Rowlands! Just where do you think you're going? Don't you know that the afternoon shift started half an hour ago?' 
'Oh, Lor',' breathed Anne. 'That's torn it.' She came to a halt. 'I'm sorry, Sergeant Venables. I know I should have reported to you earlier, but...'
'My daughter has had a bad shock,' said Rowlands. 'I'm taking her home for a few days.'
'Not without permission,' the WAAF officer retorted. 'Unless she wants to be put on a charge.'
'She does have permission.'  Briefly, he explained the circumstances. 'Hmph,' said Sergeant Venables, when he had finished. 'I don't like the sound of this. Death threats. In a place like this, such things have a way of getting out of hand.'
Rowlands agreed.
'Nonetheless,' said the woman in a more conciliatory tone. 'As I'm your superior officer, you should have come to me in the first instance, Aircraftwoman.'
'Yes, Sergeant. I'm sorry, Sergeant.'
'You should at least have told me about the telephone call, as soon as I came into the office,' went on Sergeant Venables. 'That might have been traced, you know, if we'd got onto it straight away. Now it's probably too late. As for the note and the bullet, I suppose the police have those now?'
'Yes, Sergeant.'
'Hmph. Let's see what they can make of them. Although my feeling is that these things are better dealt with by the Service.' Agatha Venables sighed. 'All right. You'd better fetch your things. I'll let Section Leader Henderson know. Assuming that you haven't already done so,' she added drily.

In the barrack-room --- one of a row of Nissen huts --- they found a number of the women from the morning shift enjoying a break. Several were smoking, some flipped through magazines, or caught up on chores. 'Anybody got a needle and cotton?' one girl shouted, as Rowlands and Anne walked in. 'I've got to sew this button on my tunic before parade, or the Hellcat'll tear me off a strip...'
The appearance of Rex elicited a chorus of fond remarks:
'What a love!'
'Isn't he a super dog?'
'Oh, I do miss my doggie!'
Then a voice Rowlands recognised said, 'We missed you this morning, young Anne. I suppose you were busy giving evidence again?'
'That's right, Joyce. I was,' said Anne, dragging her suitcase out from under the narrow bed, with its straw-filled 'biscuit' mattress and rough grey blankets. She started taking things out of the locker between this and the next bed, and throwing them into the case. 'Now, where did I put that wretched gas-mask?'
'Are you going somewhere?' said Joyce Taylor.
'Yes. I've been granted some leave.'
'Pity. You'll miss the party.'
'What party's that?' asked Anne casually. 'Ah, there's my gas-mask. Under my coat, where I left it...'
'Oh you know,' put in another voice. Again it sounded familiar to Rowlands. 'Rupert's party. It's in London. Belgravia, don't you know? It'll be ever such a swish affair.'
'Oh yes. I'm sure it will be, Dilys. D'you mind taking my suitcase, Daddy?'
'I don't suppose you were invited, were you?' said Joyce slyly. 'Seeing as you're not exactly the dashing Rupert's blue-eyed girl...'
'Do dry up, Taylor,' said Jean Underhill, coming in at that moment. 'Nobody's interested in your fatuous opinions. Section Leader want to see you before you go,' she said to Anne. 'Thanks. I'll go now. Coming, Daddy?'
With Jean leading the way, they left the stuffy, smoke-filled hut, that was home to twenty-four young women. Friendly cries of 'Have a ripping time!' and 'Don't do anything I wouldn't do,' followed them. Only when they were outside the hut did Jean ask what it 'all that' had been about. When Anne had told her, she was silent. 'How perfectly beastly,' she said at last. Rowlands said nothing, although an idea had been forming during the last few minutes. Wasn't there something rather spiteful and schoolgirlish about the whole affair? The telephone call, with its cloak-and-dagger threat, and the bullet, with its threatening note, placed in the locker by someone for whom that could have been easily accomplished? In spite of what Anne had said about the women not having access to guns, it surely wouldn't have been difficult for one of them to get hold of a single bullet?
The same thought must have occurred to Jean, for she said,  'I'm sorry, but that Joyce is nothing but a bitch.'
'I don't believe she'd do such a thing,' said Anne.
'Oh you! You're too damn nice, that's your trouble,' said her friend. 'I mean, who else knew you'd be in the office on your own, at just that time? Who else could have had access to your locker? It's bound to have been her... or one of her cronies.'
'But why?' cried Anne. 'I mean... I know she doesn't much like me, but...'
'Joyce Taylor'll do anything to get in with the Moncrieff crowd,' said Jean. 'You must have seen the way she sucks up to him. "Oh Rupert, you're so brave... Oh Rupert, do have one of my ciggies..." she mimicked, giving a fair impression of the girl's affected voice. 'But Rupert's engaged,' objected Anne.
'That wouldn't stop the Taylor,' replied Jean darkly. 'Well, better be pushing along, or the boys won't get their weather report. Nice to see you again, Mr Rowlands. 'Bye Rex. Come and see us again, won't you?'
Rowlands, not sure if it was himself or the dog that she meant, said that they would. 'I do wonder if she might not have a point,' he said to Anne, as they reached the Section Leader's office. 'It would have to have been someone with access to your locker. Miss Taylor fits the bill.'
'Perhaps,' admitted his daughter reluctantly. 'Only don't say anything about this to Section Leader Henderson, will you  Daddy? It isn't much fun having fingers pointed at you, for something you haven't done... I should know! I wouldn't want to inflict the same thing on Joyce.'
Rowlands agreed that he'd say nothing of his suspicions to Miss Henderson --- although privately he resolved to have a word with Douglas on the matter. It should, after all, be of interest to the police to know of anyone who bore a grudge against Anne Rowlands. Joyce Taylor's animosity might amount to no more than  a few spiteful comments --- but spite, he knew, could turn to hate.
Nor was he the only one to be thinking along these lines, it emerged. 'So, Aircraftwoman Rowlands,' said the Hellcat, as Anne and her father entered the office. 'It appears that someone at Mildenhall has it in for you. Any idea who that might be?'
'No, Section Leader,' said Anne is a small voice. 'Hmph,' said the WAAF officer. 'I can see I'll have to ask around. Can't have this sort of thing going on, you know. Bullying. Bad for morale.'
'Yes, Section Leader.'
'Well, if you won't tell, you won't tell,' said the older woman kindly. 'Can't say I blame you for keeping mum. Heard anything from that young man of yours?'
'No, Section Leader.' At which Rowlands felt glad that he hadn't told her about his midnight rendezvous with Jan Wawrzkowicz. Anne would have found it difficult to lie. 'Hmph,' said the Hellcat again. 'Probably best for you to be out of things for a while. I don't like what's been happening at Mildenhall one bit. Bad enough to have to deal with what... well, what we're all dealing with here, on a daily basis, without some joker playing nasty tricks. Don't you agree, Mr Rowlands?'
He said that he did.
'Very well. You'd better collect your pay from the office, and say that I've signed you off for the rest of the month. Now go home, forget about all this, and occupy yourself with other things --- helping your mother, for instance. I'm sure she'll be glad of another pair of hands... Yes, what is it, Aircraftwoman?' 
'It's just that... I will be allowed to come back to the airfield, won't I?'
'I don't see any reason why not, when this is all cleared up.'
'Because I really want to do my bit,' said the young woman vehemently. 'I won't be scared off.'

Emerging, a few minutes later, from the Section Leader's office, they were hailed by Sandy Macpherson. 'I say, Fred! Anne! Just the people I want to see. I've got some time available now, as it happens. Brenda...'  --- his assistant now having resumed her duties --- 'see if you can get hold of one of the cameramen, will you? They only need one camera for the shots inside the plane, so we can do the exterior shots at the same time. I thought over by the runway would be best, so that we can get the planes taking off in the same shot. Take advantage of the late afternoon light...'
Still talking, he began to move off, as if expecting the others to follow. 'Well, come on then, Fred!' he called encouragingly. 'And bring the dog. He's essential to the shot.'
'Look here,' said Rowlands, finding his voice at last. 'I don't know what it is you've got in mind, Macpherson...'
'Sandy, please!'
'Sandy, then. But I'm afraid it's no go. Anne and I are leaving Mildenhall, just as soon as the superintendent's ready to go. You'll have to find somebody else.'
'But that'll ruin my closing shot!' wailed the young man. 'The human interest angle's important, if we're to get the message across. Tell him, Brenda.'
Miss Pettifor agreed that the human interest angle was important.
'I'm sorry, said Rowlands. 'That's just the way it is.' Because at that moment he heard Alasdair Douglas taking his leave of the group captain, as both came out of the adjacent building. 'But... but when will you be back?' cried Macpherson. 'Can't say, I'm afraid.' Rowlands held out his hand towards the film director, who took it, somewhat reluctantly. 'Goodbye, Sandy. It's been an interesting experience, working with you on your picture. I hope it does very well.'
Leaving the disconsolate Macpherson to brood over this latest hitch, Rowlands and Anne joined Douglas in the police vehicle, which was even then starting up. Without further ado, they set off along the Cambridge road, leaving RAF Mildenhall and all its secrets behind.


### Chapter Thirteen ###

They were in London by a little after six, and driving along Whitehall towards Scotland Yard by the time Big Ben had finished striking the half-hour. Douglas's offer of getting the car to take them on to Victoria Station was declined by Rowlands, who said that he and Anne would make their own way there. 'I thought we'd get a bite of supper first. You'd be welcome to join us, Superintendent.'
But the policeman said that he had work to do before the night was over. 'Ye'll have things to talk about, the two o' ye, nae doubt,' he added; because conversation in the car, during the long drive down from Suffolk, had necessarily been general. 'Stay in touch, won't ye, Fred?' had been his parting remark. 'It may be that we'll have a breakthrough on this wretched case, afore too long. As for you, lassie,' he said to Anne in a humorous tone. 'Try and stay out o' trouble, as far as ye can.'
Anne said demurely that she would. But when she and her father were standing outside on the street, she said, 'I'm sorry, Daddy, but I won't be coming back to Brighton with you tonight.'
Rowlands, who had been deliberating aloud as to which of the restaurants in the vicinity were still open, and whether it was worth retracing their steps towards the Strand, where they'd find a bit more choice, stopped in his tracks. 'Oh?' he said. 'Why's that?'
'I... Can't we find somewhere we can sit down? A pub, for preference.'
'The Red Lion's nearest.'
'Then let's go there. Gosh, it's black as pitch without the street lamps. Hang on, I've got my torch somewhere.' She switched it on. 'Are you sure it's this way?'
'Pretty sure.'
And indeed it wasn't long before they found the place, following the sounds of laughter and convivial chat that could be heard as they approached. They entered, and were soon ensconced within the famous Westminster pub's warm and lighted interior. 'What'll you have?' said Rowlands to his daughter. 'Oh, a half of whatever you're having, please.' This was draught bitter --- not that there was a great deal of choice these days --- and so, once they'd carried their drinks to the quietest available corner, he said, 'All right. What exactly is this all about?'
Anne took a sip of her beer before replying. 'I'm afraid I haven't been entirely straight with you,' she said. That makes two of us, he thought. 'I've had a letter... from Jan. He's in London. He wants me to meet him... and I'm going to, so don't try and persuade me not to.'
'I wouldn't dream of it.'
'It'll be quite all right,' she said. 'I'll get a later train. Jan's asked me to meet him at eight, at the Polish Hearth Club, in Prince's Gate. He took me there once before, as a matter of fact,' she added; then with a touch of defiance, 'You needn't worry. It's quite respectable.'
'I don't doubt it. But...'
'But what?' she interrupted. 'Daddy, you've got that look on your face... as if you disapprove. Honestly, you're so old-fashioned! Lots of girls meet their friends...'
'Men friends, you mean?'
'What of it?' she flared up. 'We're at war, Daddy, in case you hadn't noticed. The old rules don't apply.'
Rowlands said nothing to this, but took a draught of his beer. Really, the stuff was getting weaker every day. Soon it would be little more than flavoured water... 'I'm sorry,' said his daughter after a moment. 'It's just that it's all been so horrid. Jan being arrested, and then not knowing what had happened to him for all that time, and now...'
'You don't have to explain. One thing does worry me, though...' Rowlands lowered his voice, although the people at the next table were making such a row it was unlikely that he would be overheard. 'Your chap's on the run. How on earth did he manage to get down to London, with the police still looking for him?'
'There are ways,' said Anne airily. 'Jan's got friends everywhere. They're a very loyal crowd,' she added, meaning the Polish expatriates, Rowlands supposed. 'Anyway, we're going to have dinner, so I won't have anything now, if you don't mind, Daddy. I'll try not to be back too late.'
'Oh, I'm coming with you,' said her father, making up his mind. 'It's time I met this fellow of yours --- officially.'
She seemed about to protest; then she laughed. 'All right,' she said. 'I don't see that it can do any harm. He's asked me about you, you know. Wanted to hear about your war service. Said it was men like you who'd made England the great country she is. The trouble is, Jan said, there are some who want to pull her down.'

They caught a Number 9 bus from Trafalgar Square along Piccadilly. Even though it was long past the rush hour, the bus was full, with people who'd stopped off for a 'quick one' on the way home from work mingling with those for whom the evening was just beginning. Since the nightly bombing raids which had so terrorised the city two years before had ceased, London had returned to a kind of normality, with pubs, restaurants and theatres closed down during the dark days of the Blitz now re-opening.
Just about everyone on the crowded bus was smoking --- Craven A and Lucky Strike being the most popular brands --- and the air was thick with the smell, as well as that of the hair oil and perfume (Rowlands caught a whiff of Yardley's English Lavender and Elizabeth Arden's Blue Grass), with which those heading out for an evening's entertainment had anointed themselves. 'Right down inside, please!' cried the conductress, a cheerful soul, who'd evidently taken a shine to Rex. ''Oo's a good boy, then? Look at 'im, lyin' there good as gold. What's 'is name then?' She seemed highly amused by the reply. 'Rex! That's a scream, that is! Like the Kinema, ain't you, Rexy-boy? What's showin' tonight then? Anyfing good?' Then, sternly, as her eye fell on some potential fare evader: 'Any more fares now? Move right along inside!'
As the bus lumbered along Haymarket, they passed the Theatre Royal, where Coward's Present Laughter was playing on alternate nights with his patriotic piece, This Happy Breed. In Piccadilly Circus, the plinth that had once supported the figure of Eros, was now empty and boarded-up. 'What an ugly lump it is,' said Anne. It struck Rowlands that she would hardly be able to remember the way the monument had looked before the war. 'You'd think they could put up something more attractive.' And certainly the famous 'circus', which had had a dubious reputation for as long as Rowlands could remember, had not improved in recent years, with the clubs and eating houses in the vicinity a magnet for American soldiers, and women selling their services to the latter.
He said nothing of this to Anne, who was in any case still preoccupied with how 'hideous' London looked, with everything blacked-out and boarded-up. They were passing the Royal Academy --- the conductress having just called out the name of the stop --- and he said, to distract her, 'Did you know I was once exhibited there?' Even though more than ten years had passed, he remembered the excitement of that day. Turning up in his tail-coat, as custom decreed, the honoured guest of the man who'd painted the portrait, his friend Percy Loveless, RA. 
'Oh yes,' said Anne. 'That's the painting we've got at home, isn't it? I suppose it's good, if you like that rather hard-edged, Cubist style. Bit out of fashion, now. I'd like to see the Laura Knight,' she went on, naming an artist whose latest piece --- a study of a female munitions worker --- was likely to be included in the forthcoming Summer Exhibition. 'There was a photograph of it in the paper the other day. She's really good, I think.'
Rowlands, whose appreciation of modern art --- or art of any kind --- was necessarily limited, made a non-committal reply, and the bus lurched off again, passing, he knew, Green Park on the one hand, and the select purlieus of Mayfair on the other. He retained visual memories of both --- although these were overlaid by more recent impressions, acquired since he'd become blind. He fitted them all into his mental map of the city. One never knew when one might not have to rely on this.
 ''Yde Park Corner!' yelled the conductress, as they reached that celebrated island in the stream of traffic flowing from all four directions, presided over, as it was, by the Wellington Arch. Now they were moving along Knightsbridge, with Hyde Park on one side and the grand reaches of Belgravia on the other. It was a world with which he had little to do, and yet once, over a decade ago --- around the same time as the portrait had been painted, in fact --- he'd been swept up in its treacherous glamour. 
In the seat behind where he and Anne were sitting, a couple were discussing the promenade concert they hoped to attend when the season began at the Royal Albert Hall. 'It ought to be a good one,' opined the young man. 'There'll be the usual crowd-pleasing stuff, of course --- Elgar and Vaughan Williams  and so on --- but some things worth listening to... I fancy the Rachmaninov. There'll be some Wagner, too. Trouble is, the Old Man's such a stickler for time-keeping, and the concert starts at six. Might be tricky to get away in time.'
'You're lucky you're not on the night shift,' laughed the young woman. 'Some of us have forgotten what it's like to have a social life!'
'Well, try and get the time off, if you can,' was the reply. 'Surely the Light Programme can do without you for one night?' From which Rowlands surmised that these two must work for the BBC in some capacity. He thought wistfully of the last time he and Edith had been to the 'Proms' --- it must have been before the war. Of course, the concerts initiated by Sir Henry Wood had only been revived in the past couple of years, and even then it was under wartime restrictions. Perhaps, if Edith agreed, they could make a weekend of it? Stay overnight with Ralph and Diana in Richmond, and go to one of the summer concerts... 'Knightsbridge!' sang the conductress. 'Prince's Gate next stop.'
It was just before eight when they reached the Polish Hearth Club --- one of a terrace of Victorian mansions built in the neo-classical style to be found throughout this part of London, Rowlands recalled, and which were now home to embassies, government offices and private members' clubs. In the large marble-floored entrance hall, which echoed to the sound of Polish voices, and the military step of Polish servicemen, Anne gave their names to a porter, and was directed by him to take a seat, while he went to find their host. 'You know, I've been wondering,' said Anne, when she and her father had sat down. 'What was it you meant, when you said you'd be meeting Jan "officially"?' 
Rowlands was spared from replying by the arrival of Wawrzkowicz himself. 'Ah! You made it then!' he said, addressing Anne. 'And you have brought your father. It is good to see you again, Mr Rowlands --- and the splendid Rex. Come,' --- before Anne had time to ask when exactly the two men had met --- 'we will not be disturbed in here. It is a private sitting room. At least we will be able to hear ourselves speak --- which would not be the case elsewhere in the building. My countrymen, you will have observed, seem to feel it necessary to converse at the tops of their voices.'
And indeed from the room to the left of the foyer, which Rowlands guessed must be the bar, came the rumble of male voices raised in good-humoured dispute, interspersed with shouts of laughter, and the clinking of glasses --- all of which sounds were cut off when the door was closed behind them. 'Do sit down,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'What will you have to drink? We have beer, of course. Vodka, if you prefer.'
'Beer would suit me fine,' said Rowlands.
But Anne wasn't to be put off so easily. 'Why didn't you tell me you'd met?' she demanded indignantly. It wasn't clear to which of the two men she'd addressed the question. Both started to speak at once.
'I was going to tell you, only...'
'Your father gave his word not to...' Wawrzkowicz broke off; then laughed. 'What does it matter? You are here. Let us have a drink, and I will explain everything.'
Over tall glasses of Grodziskie beer --- 'Our Polish champagne,' said Wawrzkowicz --- the resistance fighter put his guests in the picture. 'I wanted to tell you face to face,' he said, and it was obvious that it was Anne to whom he was talking. 'I am going on a mission. I cannot tell you anything about it, except that it is of the utmost importance to our cause. Our General Sikorski --- of whom you will have heard, Mr Rowlands --- has chosen me, out of all the others, to carry out this work. That is why I have come to London, because my orders are so secret that they have to be conveyed in person.'
'When are you leaving?' said Anne. 'I cannot say,' was the reply. 'It might be next week, or it might be next month... or the one after that. 'Which is why I asked you to meet me here. There might not be time for us to see one another again, once I have returned to Station 43.'
'Oh.' There was a bleakness in that one syllable that made Rowlands' heart go out to his daughter. He got to his feet. 'I'm going outside for a smoke,' he said. 'I'll leave you two to talk things over.'
In the bar, someone was singing in a tuneless voice. A burst of raucous laughter came from another part of the room. Rowlands, with Rex padding ahead of him, shouldered his way through the crowd of inebriated men. He didn't blame them for wanting to get a bit 'lit', in the circumstances, but it would be good to be able to hear himself think.
Outside, he lit a cigarette, shivering slightly in the chill night breeze, and considered what he'd been told. Of course it was inevitable that a man like Wawrzkowicz would place country ahead of private life. But it was hard on Anne. She's young. She'll get over it, he told himself. But even as he had the thought, he knew it wasn't true.
Rowlands finished his cigarette. The drunken singing, too, had stopped. He realised in the same moment that he was not only feeling cold, but hungry. It seemed a long time since that sandwich in the pub with Douglas. Perhaps the buffet at Victoria Station would still be open? He wondered how long his daughter was going to be, and if she'd agree to return to Brighton with him...  
Just then, the object of these reflections pushed open the double doors through which they'd entered the building, and descended the steps to where her father was standing. 'It's all right, Daddy. You can come in now. We've said all we wanted to say to one another.'
'Not all, I hope,' said Wawrzkowicz, who had followed her out. 'But let's go inside. It is too cold to stay out here. And you must have something to eat, before you go. There is quite a decent restaurant downstairs. Despite what you might have heard, Mr Rowlands, Polish cuisine is not just beetroot soup and potato pancakes!'
At their host's suggestion, he ordered for them, and when the food arrived --- pork cutlets, covered in crisp breadcrumbs, and served with boiled potatoes and stuffed cabbage --- it was very good. 'It is not French cuisine, you know,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'But it is good for keeping out the cold in the long Polish winters.' With the meal, he ordered champagne. 'Not the Polish kind, this time, but the genuine variety. It is correct for such an occasion, is it not?'
'Jan...' began Anne in a warning tone; but the young officer continued nevertheless. 'Your daughter has done me the honour of consenting to be my wife,' he said to Rowlands. 'Since we are at war, it seems expedient to wait until the hostilities are over, before solemnising the match. If I am killed...'
'Jan!'
'No, let me say it, dearest. If I do not return from this mission of which I was speaking earlier, then I would not wish Anne to give up the chance of finding happiness with someone else.'
'I don't want anyone else.'
'Therefore, it is to be a very quiet engagement... but one, I hope, that you will agree to celebrate with us in the traditional way... thus.' Wawrzkowicz suited the action to the word by pouring them all a glass of champagne. 'Now we will drink together,' he said. 'What shall we drink to?'
'To your safe return,' said Rowlands, raising his glass. 'And to your happiness, both of you.'
'To happiness,' echoed Jan Wawrzkowicz, quaffing his champagne.
'To love,' said Anne, draining her own glass.

On the train to Brighton, Anne said little --- seemingly lost in thought. Rowlands, too, had much to think about. There was, first of all, the bombshell about the engagement... although in fact it hadn't come as that much of a surprise. Even before he'd met Wawrzkowicz, and seen the kind of man he was, he'd known from Anne's fierce defence of the Polish fighter that he must be more than just a casual boyfriend. Throughout the past weeks, she'd never wavered in believing him innocent of the crimes of which he'd been accused. Having spent only a few hours in Wawrzkowicz's company, Rowlands could understand something of what had inspired this passionate loyalty.
Was it simply hero-worship, he wondered. Well, time would tell... that is, if the young couple had time ahead of them... He brushed away the thought. There was no sense in getting morbid. Wawrzkowicz's matter-of-fact attitude towards the possibility that he might be killed in action was the best one.
What to say to Edith about this latest development was more problematic. Hostile to the 'foreigner' from the first, she'd only become more suspicious of the role he was playing in Anne's life, as the weeks had passed. The fact that Wawrzkowicz was a man on the run from the authorities was not one that Edith could overlook. Her husband's repeated absences from home, owing to his involvement in the manhunt, had only exacerbated her resentment. Rowlands shuddered at the thought of what she would say when she learned that Anne intended to marry the man she saw as the cause of all this trouble.
As if she had been following his thoughts with her own, Anne said suddenly, 'There's no need for Mummy to know about this.' Then, when her father began to object: 'I'm not even going to say anything to Margaret. Jan's given me a ring --- it was his mother's --- but I'm not going to wear it. I think I should wait until he's back from his mission. That'll be the time to break the news.'
'If that's what you want, I won't say anything,' said Rowlands --- although he didn't much like keeping things from Edith. Once before, when his own feelings had been at stake, he'd been less than honest with his wife. He'd felt shabby about that at the time, and he felt the same now. But it was Anne's decision.

### Chapter Fourteen ###

When he got back to the office, Rowlands found things had moved on. John Harvey, who had stepped into the breach by taking on some of the day-to-day tasks which would otherwise have been neglected in Rowlands' absence, had now, to his own delight, found a job. 'I'll be using my telephony skills,' he said. 'And my morse code will come in handy, too.'
'Isn't it grand?' exclaimed Mavis Bates, who'd been instrumental in finding the job for her friend in the first place, having seen an ad for 'wireless operators' in the local paper. 'Tailor-made for you, I'd say!'
'Yes, I couldn't have wished for anything better,' agreed Harvey eagerly. 'Although I'll have to have some more training before I start.' This was to be the following month, he added. 'So I won't be helping out here after the end of the week, I'm afraid.'
'You've already done a great deal,' said Rowlands, who was almost as pleased as his young protegé at the news of Harvey's appointment. 'For which I'm very grateful. And with Anne here to help out for the next week or two, we'll manage, I'm sure --- won't we, Anne?'
'Oh. Yes. Yes, of course,' said his daughter, as if her thoughts were elsewhere.'But you'll be glad to be doing something of your own,' said Rowlands to Harvey. 'Rather,' was the young man's reply. 'I want to do my bit you know, and this... well, I can't say much about what I'll actually be doing, but it will help to make a difference, I hope.'
'I'm sure it will,' said Rowlands, thinking how much it mattered to those like themselves to feel they were making a useful contribution. From the little John Harvey had said about his new job, he guessed that it must be connected to the network of listening posts --- 'Y stations'--- to be found at strategic points across the country, which supplied 'Station X' (the official name for Bletchley Park) with its raw material of intercepts. He only knew as much because he'd visited Bletchley on several occasions two years before, while trying to solve a case in which his eldest daughter, Margaret --- who worked at 'the Park' --- had been caught up. But of course he said nothing of this to Harvey or the girls. 'Why don't you two run along?' he went on, realising that it was nearing lunchtime. 'Anne and I can hold the fort, can't we?'
'What? Oh yes,' said his daughter listlessly. Really, thought Rowlands, she'd better shake off this lethargic attitude if she were going to be any use. He guessed she was worrying about Wawrzkowicz, and his secret --- and no doubt dangerous --- mission. But worrying didn't get you anywhere.
Mavis was putting on her coat. 'John's been promising to treat me to a celebratory lunch for weeks...'
'Hardly weeks.'
'Days, then. But it'll be nice not to have to rush back.'
When their voices could no longer be heard on the stairs, Rowlands said to his daughter, 'Look. I know you've got things on your mind, but you're not the only one with troubles.'
'I know, I know.'
'If you're going to be of any use to me as an assistant, you've got to stop moping and buckle down to some hard work.' He was aware that it sounded harsh, but knew it was the only cure. 'All right. I'm sorry. I'll do my best,' she said.
'That's my girl. You can start by putting these files in order. It'll be a nice surprise for Mavis, when she gets back from lunch.'

The rest of the week passed in the usual humdrum office work, interspersed with the vagaries of domestic life. Rowlands had warned Edith not to say anything provocative on the subject of Anne's 'friend', and so the atmosphere at home was one of strained politeness. The reason for Anne's enforced leave from RAF Mildenhall had only exacerbated the situation. 'What do you mean --- she's been threatened? What kind of threats?' Edith had demanded, when her husband had attempted to put her in the picture. Then, when it had been explained to her that what seemed at first sight like an ill-natured prank might have more serious implications: 'I knew it! She'd never have been drawn into this if it hadn't been for that fellow...'
In vain did Rowlands protest that it was nothing to do with Wawrzkowicz, and the likelihood was that Anne had merely incurred the jealous wrath of one of her fellow WAAFs. 'You know what it's like, when a lot of people... women, in this instance... are locked up together, day after day, working long hours. Tempers get frayed. It probably means nothing.' The fact that he didn't believe this made his protest seem feeble, even to him.
He'd arrived in the office early on the Saturday morning. There was still work to catch up with, after the weeks he'd taken off. Anne was still in bed when he set off. After her initial lack of enthusiasm, she'd thrown herself into the office routine with more of her usual energy, becoming fast friends with Mavis Bates and young Harvey in the process. The previous night, the three of them had gone out for drinks after work, returning very late, and so it was out of consideration for his daughter's probable state that he decided not to call her. It would do her good to kick over the traces, for once. She'd been living on her nerves for too long.
The telephone rang. Now who could that be, at this hour? It was still only half past eight. 'Hello? After-Care Unit. Frederick Rowlands speaking.'
'Ah, Fred. Your good lady said I'd find you her --- bright and early, as ever.'
'What can I do for you, Superintendent?' He felt a surge of excitement. 'Has there been a development?'
'As a matter of fact, there has. I can't say too much about it now, but it appears that our investigations may have borne fruit.'
'You've got a name.'
'Well, not that exactly --- but we do have a lead... and there's better news yet --- as I expect your daughter will tell you.'
'Do you mean Anne? What's she go to do with this?'
'I can't talk now,' said Douglas. 'I'll tell you more when we meet.'
'Hang on a minute. This is the first you've said about meeting...'
'I'll send a car to pick you up after work,' said the other, with maddening imperturbability. 'Expect it about five o'clock.'
'Wait. What?' But the superintendent had already hung up.
Rowlands was still puzzling over this, when he heard Anne's footsteps on the stairs; a moment later, she burst in. 'Daddy, you'll never guess what's happened! I've had a telegram. Oh, it's nothing to do with Jan,' she added, perhaps seeing his concerned look. 'It's from Jean Underhill. She wants me to go to a party, as her guest. It's tonight --- hence the telegram. Isn't it exciting?'
'Who's giving the party?' said her father, although a suspicion was already forming. 'Oh, didn't I say? It's Rupert Moncrieff --- the party's at his parents' home in Belgrave Square. Isn't it nice of him to have asked me, after all?'
With the prospect of this festive occasion ahead of her, Anne was a transformed character --- her fits of melancholia forgotten in excited discussion with Mavis Bates --- who had come into the office to finish some typing --- as to what she should wear. An evening gown of her mother's, with the sleeves cut off and the neckline altered (Anne was good with her needle) would fit the bill, she thought. 'Black satin's back in fashion, and Margaret won't mind if I borrow her silver shoes... There's bound to be dancing. Do you think there'll be dancing, Daddy?'
'I couldn't say.'
'A corsage would look lovely with a black frock,' opined Mavis; adding shyly, 'I've one you could borrow, if you like. A silver orchid.'
'Thanks, Mavis. You're a pal. I wonder if I'll need gloves?'
By lunchtime it was plain that no more work was going to be done, and so Rowlands sent both girls home (Mavis was going to help with the alterations to the dress). He was glad to see Anne in good spirits, but couldn't shake off the feeling that something was awry. That Rupert Moncrieff should have changed his mind about inviting Anne to his party he could just about believe, but that the invitation had come so pat, after what he'd been told by Douglas on the telephone, stretched credulity.
His suspicions were only confirmed when the car Douglas had sent for him arrived on the dot of five. 'Super said I was to collect two passengers,' said the WPC who was driving. 'Yourself and the young lady, sir.'
So there was a connection between Douglas's telephone call and the invitation to Moncrieff's party! Rowlands could only speculate as to what it all meant. He said nothing of his misgivings to Anne, who was predictably delighted to be given a lift to London, instead of having to travel up on the train. 'Won't I be frightfully early, though? The party doesn't start until eight.' She and Jean were to stay the night with Jean's aunt, in Bedford Square. 'So there's really no need for you to escort me, Daddy.'
'Super said I was to deliver you both to the Yard,' interjected WPC Cross. 'I'm to take the young lady on to her party afterwards.'

They found Douglas in his office, smoking his pipe and leafing through a pile of papers. 'Ah, there ye are,' he said. 'Not too bad a journey, I hope?'
'The journey was fine,' said Rowlands. 'But I'd like an explanation, please.'
'All right, WPC Cross, ye can wait outside,' said Douglas. 'I'll call ye when I want ye.'
'Sir.' The door closed behind the woman police officer. 'Now then,' said the superintendent. 'Ye'd better say yer piece.'
'I want to know what's going on --- and why you've involved Anne in all this...'
'Have I?' replied the other innocently. 'I thought I was just making sure Miss Anne gets to her party on time.'
'You arranged for her to be invited to the party,' said Rowlands coldly. 'Don't deny it.'
'Daddy, really...'
'It's true, isn't it?'
'Mebbe. But what's the harm in killing two birds with one stone? Miss Anne gets her party, and I... well, let's just say I get something I want, at the same time.' 
'And what's that?'
'Information. A name. A face. Somebody who'll be at that party, and whose presence there has a bearing on the case I'm trying to crack.'
'The murder case or the conspiracy case?'
'Och, they're one and the same,' said Douglas. 'Which is why I asked ye both to come along tonight. The fact is, we've had a breakthrough. One o' the people we've been keeping an eye on in Whitehall... Och, nobody ye'll have heard of... quite a minor figure in the Civil Service, ye ken... let slip a name or two during one of our... conversations,' said Douglas, with a certain emphasis that told Rowlands the word meant something more rigorous. 'Seems like one o' the names this person blurted out is that of a person already of interest to our investigation. We've suspected for some time that this individual has connections to the, er, organisation of which I was telling you, Fred.'
National Resurgence, thought Rowlands. He was grateful to Douglas for keeping the name of that dubious outfit to himself. The less Anne knew about all this the better. 'Aye,' went on the superintendent. 'And that's where Miss Anne here can be of use to us. Because if I'm right, and this person turns up at the house where the party is being held tonight, it'll be the confirmation we need. Och, it's very clever of whoever's organising this --- to use the excuse of young Moncrieff's birthday celebrations to arrange a very different kind of meeting. It'll be a regular gathering o' the brotherhood tonight, it seems. Our friend Mr Ramsden will be there, and Lord Haverstock, o' course. A couple o' the ladies, too. Mrs Gibbon and Lady Morley. Both do a lot of charitable work, I'm told --- when they aren't fulminating against "aliens" and "foreign influences". Och aye, a verrae distinguished set o' people.'
'I don't quite see...' began Rowlands.
'Ye'll be saying it's a funny sort o' crowd for a twenty-first birthday party --- and ye'll be right,' said Douglas. 'But I'm telling ye, what could be a better cover for their goings-on, these folk, than a birthday celebration?'
'Well, I still don't like it,' said Rowlands. 'You had no right to involve Anne. If I understand what you're saying, you're asking her to put herself in danger...'
'I'm asking no such thing,'said Douglas. 'All she has to do... and that only if she agrees to it... is to go to her party, and keep her eyes and ears open for anything untoward. We'll do the rest.'
'I want to do it,' said Anne. 'If it'll help find the man who killed Jonny, and Mr Pryce... and prove Jan's innocence... then you can count me in.'

The  car drew up across the street from the  Belgravia mansion where the party was being held. Music from a jazz quartet could be heard issuing from inside, and as the five of them (including Miss Underhill, whom they'd collected en route) prepared themselves for what the evening would bring, taxis were arriving, disgorging their passengers, whose laughter and chatter preceded them into the house. 'Gosh,' said Anne is a small voice. 'I hadn't realised it'd be quite so grand.'
'Well, it's Rupert's father's place, you know,' said Jean Underhill airily. 'So I suppose it would be. Nice of him to let us borrow it for the evening, isn't it?'
'They need to get that blackout seen to,' said Douglas disapprovingly. 'I'm surprised the local ARP warden hasn't spotted it... All right, then, ladies,' he went on, addressing the girls. 'Time ye were joining your friends. We'll be right here,' he added in an undertone to Anne, as she scrambled out of the car after her friend. 'That's good to know.' Anne's nervous laugh renewed her father's fears. 'Look,' he began. 'If you don't feel up to this...'
'I'll be fine,' she said. 'With you in a minute,' she cried to Jean. 'Just putting on my mask.' Because it was to be a masked ball, her friend had revealed when they'd picked her up from Bedford Square. 'Don't worry, I've brought one for you. Black velvet --- it'll go nicely with your dress.'
Then the girls were across the street and, after a brief interval, were admitted to the house. 'Looks as if they're pushing the boat out,' muttered Douglas. 'Butler answering the door, and no end of chauffeur-driven cars lined up outside. You'd never guess there was a war on.'
'What I still don't understand,' said Rowlands, 'is what you're trying to achieve, by getting Anne to report back? I mean, you already know about Lord Haverstock's links to National Resurgence. Unless you actually catch him in the act of committing treason, you can't touch him.'
'True enough. Which is why I need to find out as much as possible about who he's seeing --- and what they're up to. Putting two and two together... a hint from this source, and another from that... I've a strong suspicion they're planning something big. I won't know what it is until I've confirmed certain things --- who's running the show, and where the operation's going to take place. If I can discover that, I'll have them,' said the superintendent, with grim satisfaction.
Having left instructions with the constable posted outside the house that he was to report any unusual comings or goings by telephoning the office at regular intervals from the telephone box along the street, Douglas said to Rowlands that there was little point in their remaining. 'Dobson'll be keeping an eye on the place from the outside. But for the "inside story", we'll have to wait for Miss Anne's report, which we can't expect until the party breaks up. No doubt that won't be until sometime after midnight,' he added, with his habitual disapproval of all such frivolities.
They were back at Scotland Yard within fifteen minutes, having taken the short cut along Constitution Hill and Birdcage Walk. At that time of night there was little traffic in any case, and the powerful police car sped along the quiet streets behind Green Park and St James's Park, with scarcely a pause. It was at times like these, that Rowlands realised how much he missed London --- a city of which, like Dr Johnson, he never tired. Oh, Brighton had its charms, of course --- but it couldn't compare with this. In his mind's eye he envisaged once more the spacious streets and avenues, the tranquil parks, with their trees, and lakes and waterfowl, the grand terraces and noble public buildings of his birthplace... all of it, he knew, now rather battered by the activities of the Luftwaffe, but still the beautiful city of his memories.       
On arriving back in his office, Douglas sent out for beer and sandwiches. 'We might be in for a longish wait,' he said --- to which Rowlands replied that it didn't matter to him. As long as he could be there --- as close to the action as possible --- he didn't mind if he had to wait all night. Even so, it was hard to sit still, calmly munching ham sandwiches, when Anne might be getting involved in who knows what... 
An hour went by, before the telephone on Douglas's desk rang. 'Ah, this'll be Dobson, now,' said the superintendent. A brief exchange, of which Rowlands could hear only the former's side, ensued. 'All quiet,' he said as he replaced the receiver. 'One or two more names we've been taking an interest in have turned up --- Mr Voles, Colonel Powell --- but that's to be expected. These people are all part of the same social "set". The fact that some of 'em share the same views on what they like to call the "Jewish Question" is purely coincidental.' He took a draught of his beer. 'However, it's a coincidence I'm not prepared to overlook. Drink up,' he added, seeing that Rowlands' glass was empty. 'There's more where that came from.'
'I've had enough, thanks. So you think that something's going to come of tonight's get-together?'
'I do. Although what form it'll take is anybody's guess.'
Another hour passed. Two hours. The telephone rang at intervals with further reports from Constable Dobson, but no further news of interest. Then, at around a quarter to twelve, there came another call: 'Aye?' When whoever it was at the other end of the line spoke, Douglas's reply brought Rowlands to his feet. 'Miss Anne? I wasnae expecting...' Then, to what she said next: 'Ye're sure about that?'
'What's happened?' demanded Rowlands. But Douglas paid no attention to this, intent on what Anne was saying. 'That's verrae interesting. Now you just sit tight. Your father and I'll be there as soon as we can.' He hung up. 'Brave lassie,' he said. 'Tell me,' Rowlands almost shouted, angry at being kept in the dark. 'Is she all right?'
'Och, she's fine. Telephoned from inside the house to say she's recognised somebody. It's our man all right. Come on.' Douglas was already putting on his hat and coat. 'I'll tell ye about it on the way.'

It was around a quarter to one by the time they arrived back at the Belgravia mansion, where it appeared that the party was starting to break up. As the car drew up across the street, they could hear the loudly cheerful conversation of home-going guests, as they emerged from the open front door in search of taxis, while a more fortunate few sought the cars which had bought them to the party. 
Having got out of the car, Rowlands and the superintendent were crossing the street towards the house, when Jean Underhill, who must have been among the throng of partygoers, ran up to them. 'Thank goodness you're here, Superintendent --- and Mr Rowlands!' she cried. 'Is Anne with you?'
Rowlands felt his blood run cold. 'Do you mean she isn't with you?'
'No. I've looked all over... but I can't find her anywhere.'
Before Rowlands could interrogate the girl further, Douglas spotted his subordinate: 'There you are, Dobson! What have you got to say for yourself?
'I... I was just about to telephone you, sir,' was the policeman's disconsolate reply. 'Suspect's gone, I'm afraid. Gave me the slip...'
'What? You were told not to let him leave on any account. Now it looks as if Miss Anne's gone missing, too.' 
'It's all my fault,' said Miss Underhill. 'I only let her out of my sight for a minute...'
'When was this?' demanded Rowlands.
'Just after midnight. We'd all taken our masks off, and there was a lot of laughing and joking as people "discovered" who it was under the masks... Rather ripping fun,' the girl said bleakly. 'There was quite a crowd in the ballroom, celebrating Rupert's birthday, with cake and champagne... so it was a while before I realised that Anne wasn't there. I did look for her,' she added. 'But... but it was all a bit chaotic. The band started up again, and people were dancing... and I suppose I thought that she... Anne... had just slipped out to get a breath of air... it was fearfully hot. It must have been about fifteen minutes later, that I realised she wasn't coming back.' She shivered in her velvet evening cloak. 'What could have happened to her?'
'That's what we're going to find out,' said Rowlands. 'Starting inside that house...' But as he pushed his way through the crowd of partygoers who were even now coming out of the house, he ran slap-bang into another of their number. The latter let out an exclamation. 'What the hell?' Then: 'Oh, it's you again, Mr Rowlands. May I ask what you're doing here?' 
'Good evening, Flight Lieutenant Moncrieff. And I'm here about my daughter. I'd like to know when you last saw her.'
Before Moncrieff could reply, the young woman he was with said disdainfully, 'Who is this man, Rupert? Another of your father's guests, I suppose? Honestly, I don't see why we had to have them. It's your birthday, after all...'
'Yes, yes,' replied Moncrieff impatiently. 'We've been over all this, Olivia. Now what's all this about Anne?' he said to Rowlands. 'I only spoke to her for a moment...'
'When was this?'
'I don't know. About half an hour ago, I suppose.'
'And what did you say?'
'Rupert...'
'Just a moment, darling... I said, more or less, what I've just said to you, Mr Rowlands. That is, I asked her what she was doing at my party. I certainly hadn't invited her. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to say good night to my fiancée...'
'Mr Moncrieff,' interrupted the superintendent sternly. 'It seems as if ye were among the last to speak to Miss Anne Rowlands. That young lady can't be found at present. I'd like search the house --- and as ye seem to be one of the last to have spoken to her, I'll need ye to answer some questions...'
'This is preposterous!' said the young man. Then, to the chauffeur, who had just brought round the car: 'Take Lady Olivia back to Lowndes Square, Baxter, quick as you can.'
'But Rupert...'
'I'll telephone you later, darling --- all right?' 
Clearly, it was not 'all right' with Lady Olivia, but seeing that she had little choice in the matter, she permitted herself to be put into the car and driven off. 'Well, we can't stand about out here,' said Moncrieff, with an ill grace. 'I suppose you'd better come in.' He led the way and, as the five of them (including the uniformed man) passed the butler, who was guarding the doorway, overseeing the comings and goings of the remaining guests, he said, 'All right, Partridge. These people are with me.'
'Very good, sir.'
In the hall, which Rowlands judged to be large and lofty, a crowd of departing guests was assembled, collecting cloaks and hats, or lingering to finish off a conversation. Several of these people greeted Moncrieff: 'I say, jolly good party, what?'
'Congratters, Rupert old man. How's it feel to have reached your majority?'
One wag, spotting the unfortunate Constable Dobson, quipped: 'What's the Law doing here? Been up to something, Rupert?'
Moncrieff ignored all these remarks. 'We'll go in here,' he said to Rowlands and the others, opening a door on the left of the hall. 'Shouldn't be disturbed.' 
'You wait out here,' said Douglas to the uniformed officer. 'I'll call you when I need you.'
'Sir.'
The room into which the rest of their party entered was a library, Rowlands guessed, from the smell of books and leather upholstery. That Moncrieff had expected to find it unoccupied suggested it was not over-used, as a general rule. On this occasion, however, the pungent scent of a fine cigar drifting from somewhere across the room indicated that he was mistaken in his assumption. 'Rupie?' said a voice, confirming this impression. 'That you?'
'Oh Lor', it's the Guv'nor,' muttered Moncrieff under his breath. 'That's torn it.'
There was a brief silence, then the library's owner spoke: 'I know you. You're Stephen Underhill's gel.' This was to Jean, who murmured an affirmative. 'I don't believe I know you gentlemen, however,' the voice went on. 'Superintendent Douglas of the Metropolitan Police,' said Douglas. 'And this is Mr Rowlands. My apologies for troubling you, my lord, but I've reason to believe that one of your son's guests --- Miss Anne Rowlands --- has gone missing. I'd like your permission to search the house.'
'Hm.' The noble lord did not seem unduly perturbed by this request. 'How long has this gel been missing?'
'My daughter was last seen about three quarters of an hour ago,' said Rowlands. 'By your son, as it happens.'
'That so, Rupie?' There was a note of amusement in Haverstock's voice. 'What've you done with her, you young devil?'
'It's no laughing matter,' said Douglas, before Rupert Moncrieff could reply. 'Now, sir, if you're agreed, I'll get my officer to look over the house. I gather you've had a party here this evening.' His tone could not have been blander. 'I'll need to talk to your guests, too --- those of 'em that are still on the premises...'
'But surely,' interrupted the earl. 'It's obvious what must have happened? The gel will have gone orf with some of her friends. Crowds of 'em here earlier. Ten to one she's in some nightclub somewhere --- my son here can probably supply you with a list,' he added with faint contempt. 'He knows all the latest dives, don't you, Rupie?' 
'I'll certainly follow up your suggestion --- should the initial search prove unsuccessful,' replied Douglas evenly. He opened the door and gave an order to the policeman standing outside it. 'It shouldn't take long,' he said, addressing Haverstock once more. 'We'll try not to inconvenience you or your guests any more than we have to.'
'Wait.' There was a note of cold command in the other's voice. 'I haven't given my permission. And it seems you don't have a search warrant, Superintendent.'
'I do not. And it will mean waking up a magistrate in order to obtain one,' said Douglas. 'Which will add to the inconvenience for your guests as they will have to be detained until that time. Whereas if you will permit a brief unofficial search, we can be out of your house in ten minutes.'
 	Haverstock was silent a moment. Rowlands had the uncanny feeling that the man knew exactly why they were there --- and that, if he himself was not not responsible for Anne's disappearance, he had a shrewd idea who was. When he spoke at last, it was in the same tone of languid indifference that he had used throughout. 'Ve'y well. You may look for this gel... although I doubt you'll find her here.' He gave a harsh bark of laughter. 'There are no dungeons to be found in Belgrave Square!'
'Thank you, sir,' said Douglas. 'If you'd lead the way, Mr Moncrieff...'
'One thing,' said Haverstock. 'If I find you've been bothering my guests unduly I'll want to know the reason why. As it happens, the Commissioner of Police is a friend of mine. He won't be ve'y happy to hear about any invasion of privacy...'
'Then we must endeavour not to give him cause for complaint. Good night, my lord.' With that, Douglas opened the door. 'After you, Miss,' he said to Jean Underhill. 'Give m'regards to your father, won't you?' called the peer, as she went out. 'He and I were great chums at the House.' 


### Chapter Fifteen ###

In the hall, they found PC Dobson trying valiantly to stem the flow of partygoers intent on leaving the house. In this attempt, he was not helped by the butler, who, in charge of returning evening cloaks and hats to the departing guests, was doing his best to speed the said group on its way. Thwarted, too, by the interventions of a pair of inebriated young men, who'd seized on the presence of a uniformed policeman as the excuse for a bit of comic cross-talk, the young constable was sounding close to losing control. 'Gentlemen! Ladies! Please!' he implored the cheerfully unruly crowd that now filled the hall. 'You can't leave yet. I need your names and addresses...'
'To be sure, Mike, he wants to take down our particulars,' said one well-oiled gentleman to another, in a stage Irish accent. 'I don't like the sound o' that, Paddy, at'all, at'all,' replied the other.
'Gentlemen... Ladies... Please!'
'All right, Dobson. I'll take over,' said Douglas. 'Now then, ladies and gentlemen, have any of you seen a young lady by the name of Anne Rowlands at any time during the past two hours? Fair-haired young lady, wearing a black dress...'
But this appeal garnered no immediate results. Whether it was that Douglas's description had been too vague --- after all, there must be any number of young women in black dresses at an event like this --- or (more likely, thought her father) that this wasn't a circle of which Anne was a part, no one admitted to having seen her. After a bit of prompting from Jean Underhill, somebody thought they might have seen a girl with a silver orchid pinned to her dress going upstairs, at some point earlier that evening. It wasn't much --- but it would do for Rowlands. 
He made for the stairs --- a grand sweep, down which more guests were making their way, as they thought, towards cars and taxis, only to be caught in the net spread for them by the superintendent and his underling. In this slowly descending crowd, Rowlands, ascending, felt himself accosted. A voice he knew said in his ear, 'Mr Rowlands. Don't look surprised. I'd rather we were strangers to one another just now...'
He nodded, keeping his expression impassive. On reflection, it wasn't a surprise to find Iris Barnes (or whatever she was calling herself just now) in this particular company. 'Keep going upstairs,' she murmured. 'There's an ante-room to your left, off the ballroom. We'll talk in there.' In a louder voice, designed to be heard by those nearby, she exclaimed, as if to herself, 'Hell! I've lost my cigarette case. Must have dropped it somewhere.' With which she turned around, murmuring apologies as she pushed her way back through the throng, and caught up with Rowlands on the landing. 'In here,' she said in an undertone.
The room, as she'd doubtless already known, proved to be empty; although sounds of revelry came from the adjacent ballroom, as a few stragglers took a last turn around the floor. 'Well,' she began. 'I wasn't expecting...'
But Rowlands cut across her. 'Have you seen my daughter, Anne?' he demanded. 'She's disappeared.'
'Ah.' There was a world of meaning in the syllable. 'Can you describe her? Although I think I caught a glimpse of her at Mildenhall, during the filming. She must be --- what? Twenty?'
'She's twenty-one. Slim, fair-haired, about five foot three. Wearing a black evening dress, with... I gather... a silver orchid corsage.' 
'I believe I have seen her this evening.' Miss Barnes' voice was grave. 'It must have been no more than an hour ago... after the meeting broke up. I assume that you know about that?'
'The National Resurgence meeting? Yes.'
'Well, as I said, the meeting had already ended when I saw her... or a girl who might have been her. I'd already left the room where the meeting was held, and was about to join the birthday celebrations in the ballroom, when I heard a commotion in the room I'd just quitted. Someone... a girl... had been taken ill, I heard somebody say. They'd have to see about running her home.'
Rowlands felt his blood run cold. 'Do you think it was Anne?'
'I couldn't say for certain. She... the girl... was wrapped in a black evening cloak, with the hood pulled up over her head, so that I couldn't see her face. She was walking unsteadily... someone had to help her downstairs. I suppose I thought she must've had too much to drink...'
'Anne barely touches alcohol,' said her father fiercely.
'No need to bite my head off! The effects of drugs --- or a whiff of chloroform --- are remarkably similar to those of alcoholic inebriation. I imagine somebody in that select gathering realised that she was an interloper...' Iris Barnes sighed. 'What on earth were you thinking, Mr Rowlands, letting her walk into this nest of vipers?'
'It wasn't my idea. And you don't know Anne. She wanted to do it. Are you saying she's fallen foul of these National Resurgence people?'
'It looks like it. If she was at that meeting and somebody recognised her...' She broke off. 
'If anything's happened to her, I'll kill Douglas,' he said. 
'Ah, the good superintendent! I only hope he hasn't queered the pitch, with his clumsy manoeuvring. We've been watching these people for a long time,' the MI5 agent said grimly. 'Now Superintendent Douglas has alerted them all to the fact that they're under suspicion. He'll be to blame if Haverstock and his cronies escape justice.'
'I don't care about any of that,' said Rowlands. 'All I care about is finding my daughter.'
'I'll do what I can to help you,' said Miss Barnes. 'I can get you a car and a driver --- although I won't be able to accompany you, I'm afraid. Too much to do here, sorting out this unholy mess...'
'What good is a car if I don't know where I'm going?' he said.
'Oh, didn't I say? The last I saw of your young woman in black, she was being put into a car that had been brought round to the front of the house. This was about three quarters of an hour ago, I'd say. I was standing at the top of the stairs, you understand, so I could overhear what was said by the man escorting her, as he helped her out of the door. "As it happens, I'm driving back that way tonight," he said --- I think it was to Lord Haverstock. "So I can take her back with me. Deliver her safe and sound to her unit. She can sleep it off on the way to Mildenhall," was the last thing I heard him say.'

It was a disgruntled Superintendent Douglas who, a few minutes later, called off the house-search and gave permission for the remaining guests to resume their interrupted journeys home. 'I guessed something was up, when I saw you with that Miss Barnes,' he muttered, as he and Rowlands made their own exit from the Belgravia mansion. 'Might have known MI5 wouldnae be able to resist sticking their noses in again. Just when my case show signs of yielding some results too! The name of our murderer, for one. Now  it looks as if he's got clean away... with Miss Anne as his insurance policy. Aye, it's a nasty turn of events...'
The Jaguar SS1 Iris Barnes had ordered to take Rowlands and the superintendent to Suffolk was certainly faster than the standard police Wolseley --- reliable though that vehicle was, Douglas gruffly conceded. When, as they sped past Buckingham Place and through a deserted Westminster, he'd asked the driver --- one of Miss Barnes's operatives, presumably --- whether he could get them to their destination in under two hours, the man laughed. 'I should say so! With a 2.5 six-cylinder valve engine, she can go pretty fast.'
The superintendent replied repressively that they wouldn't need to go too fast, thanks all the same --- adding under his breath to Rowlands that, interfering female though she was, Miss Barnes knew how to pull a few strings when required. Rowlands grunted an acknowledgement. He'd had experience of Iris Barnes's 'string-pulling' capacities in the past, and knew not to underestimate her. But the fact remained that they were still a couple of hours behind the man who'd abducted Anne, for what nefarious purposes remained to be seen. He --- the abductor --- had had plenty of time to reach the airfield (if that was indeed where he was heading) and to take cover from those who were now in pursuit.
At the back of Rowlands' mind was the fear that they might already be too late. The man who'd already killed twice to prevent exposure for betraying his country would have no scruples about killing again, even if the victim was a woman. Rowlands knew his daughter to be brave and resourceful --- but even she might find it hard to talk her way out of this dire situation.
Having traversed the Mile End Road, Bow, and Stratford, they picked up speed. Epping, Harlow, Sawbridgeworth, Bishop's Stortford... The miles sped by. Thankfully, the road --- the main trunk road from London to Norwich --- was virtually deserted at that hour in the morning, which was just as well, Douglas observed, as it was black as pitch out there, with only the Jaguar's headlights (dimmed by cardboard masks) to light the way. Not that this made the slightest difference to his companion, for whom dark and light were relative concepts, but he sensed Douglas's unease as the car hurtled along into what he guessed must seem to the police officer like a terrifyingly alien territory, after the familiar streets of the latter's adopted city.
For Rowlands, used to relying on memory to furnish the darkness in which he lived, the absence of street lighting, or any other kind of lighting, in that wartime blackout, was of no consequence. His thoughts returned to something he'd found puzzling --- what link, if any, was there between National Resurgence's activities and the betrayal of foreign agents in occupied territories, of which Wawrzkowicz had spoken? So far he hadn't found one... Thinking of his son-in-law-to-be, he wondered if there was any way of getting a message to him, given that they'd be passing so close to Audley End House. 
He rejected the idea as impractical. It would mean further delay, which they could ill afford. Although if the worst came to the worst, his daughter's fiancé would have to be informed... The thought, and all that it implied, was wiped from his mind the very next moment. There came a screech of tyres, and a sickening crunch of metal. A violent jolt threw him forward, and he heard, above the loud bang that followed, somebody scream. Then he knew nothing more.

When he woke, it was to the sound of American voices. These belonged to three or four different men, he guessed, but the accent was the same.
'Gee, Sarge, the guy just came outta nowhere...' --- this was a young man, his voice high with anxiety.
'Mebbe so. But ya didn't hafta kill him...' An older, more world-weary, individual, this.
'He ain't dead, jus' a bit beat-up, is all...' The voice of an eternal optimist.
'He won't win any beauty contests, that's for sure...' A cynic, this one. 'Bust his arm and a few ribs. Guess he was lucky not to break his neck...'
Rowlands realised he was lying on some kind of army cot or camp-bed. There was a rough army blanket over him. A smell of antiseptic --- iodine, perhaps --- filled his nostrils. 'How's the old guy doing?' said the one who'd been addressed as sergeant. 'Still out for the count,' was the reply. 'But the Doc says he'll live...'
Rowlands supposed that the man must be referring to him --- although at fifty-three, he didn't regard himself as old. But to men barely out of their teens, as he supposed these fellows to be, he would doubtless seem ancient. He tried to sit up, and fell back again, as a searing pain shot through his skull. The effort, futile as it had been, drew the attention of the others. 'This one's woken up! How are ya, old timer?'
 'What happened?' he managed to croak.
It was the sergeant (evidently the group's spokesman) who replied: 'You ran into a unit of the 83rd Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group of the US 8th Air Force. Made a helluva mess of that pretty automobile of yours, I'm sorry to say. Sergeant Clancy's the name. These boys are in my outfit. We don't ordinarily act so rough towards the civilian population hereabouts.'
It wasn't the moment to explain that Rowlands and his companions were not, strictly speaking, 'civilians'. 'What happened to the other men who were with me in the car?' he said. 'Are they all right?'
'Waal...' Sergeant Clancy sounded sheepish. 'They're alive, I guess. Guy who was driving's got a bust collar-bone, cracked ribs an' a broken arm. Medics are seeing to him now.'
'And the other?'
'Still unconscious. Doc's keeping him under observation.' 
It was some comfort to know that Douglas was alive, but Rowlands still wanted an explanation. 'So you're saying our vehicle crashed into yours?'
'You got it, sir.' At least he'd dropped the 'old timer' thought Rowlands. 'Pretty little car like that's no match for a military jeep.'
'Maybe not.' Rowlands had suddenly had enough of the man's relentlessly cheery remarks. 'It's a good thing we weren't all killed. How on earth did it happen? You people must have been going terribly fast...'
'Waal, sir,' said the other. 'I reckon the fault was more on your side, if you get me? Matter o' fact, we was slowing down, before turning into the lane that leads back to base, when your Jaguar came along like a bat outta hell, and... waal, ran right into us. Like I said, army jeeps'll stand any amount of shocks. If we'd been going any faster, you'd have been smashed up more'n you were.'
'I suppose we should be grateful that you weren't,' said Rowlands, making a second attempt to sit up. This time he succeeded, although he couldn't suppress a grimace at the stab of pain that accompanied this manoeuvre. 'Hey,' said another voice --- also an American --- as someone else came into the room. 'Who said you could get up?' Because by now Rowlands had swung his legs off the camp-bed and was getting shakily to his feet. 'That's a nasty contusion you've got there. Good chance you've got concussion, too.'
This, guessed Rowlands, must be the Medical Officer. The latter advanced to within a few feet of his patient. 'Stop right there,' he said. 'How many fingers am I holding up?'
Rowlands couldn't stop himself laughing, even though he'd never felt less like it. 'It's all the same to me if it's ten fingers or a hundred,' he said. 'I'm still getting out of here --- and you can't stop me.' Then, as the doctor began to protest: 'I gather my two... er... colleagues are hors de combat at present. So one of you will have to drive me to my destination. As you'll see, if you look a bit closer, I'm unable to drive myself. Sergeant Clancy,' he went on, addressing the NCO. 'Since you and your unit are responsible for putting me in this situation, I think you should be the one to help me out of it. I've an urgent reason --- one to do with national security --- why I have to get to Mildenhall air base as quickly as possible...'
'And what reason's that?' said someone else, who had entered the room as  Rowlands was speaking. It was an older man --- but not, Rowlands thought, all that old. Thirty, perhaps. 'Major Larry Schultz at your service sir,' he said. 'I'm in command of this outfit.'
Rowlands supplied his own name, then said, 'I'm sure you'll understand, Major, that I can't go into details about my reason for needing to get to RAF Mildenhall. But I can assure you it's of the utmost importance --- as my colleague, Superintendent Douglas, would confirm --- if he were in a position to do so. But I gather he's still unconscious...'
'As a matter of fact he's just come round,' put in the doctor. 'Should make a full recovery. But he's not going anywhere for a while... and neither should you, sir, until you've rested up.'
'I haven't time to rest,' said Rowlands impatiently. 'And I'm perfectly fit --- just a few cuts and bruises. I must get to Mildenhall tonight.'
'Sure, but...' began Schultz. 
Rowlands cut across him. 'I'm sure I don't have to tell you that the British government isn't going to take kindly to having one of its operations derailed in this way. I'll need a driver, and one of your vehicles to take me to the base, and then deliver a message to Station 43...'
'How do you know about Station 43?' was the sharp rejoinder.
'Never mind. I do know about it, that's all. Now, if you've finished asking questions, I'll need to be on my way. I've wasted enough time as it is.'

It was Sergeant Clancy who took the wheel of the jeep, so that Rowlands could resume his interrupted journey. 'This time o' day...' --- it was then five a.m. --- 'shouldn't be much traffic,' he opined. 'Not unless some other joker goin' too fast runs smack into us.'
Rowlands didn't join in the man's laughter. He was all too aware of what the accident had cost them, in terms of lost time --- to say nothing of the injuries (slight in his case) he and his two colleagues had sustained. As for the Jaguar... But he couldn't get very worked-up about the damage to Miss Barnes's car. It had certainly lived up to expectations --- for the first part of the journey, at least. Although the time gained then had been lost since. God knows what effect that delay would have had on his daughter's current situation. He found himself sending silent messages to her --- hold on, Anne --- in the hope that somehow she might pick these up, and be comforted that he was nearby. 
'How far is it?' he asked Clancy, as they turned out of the lane he supposed must lead from the air base onto what seemed, from the increasing speed with which they were now travelling, to be a major road. 'We just left Duxford... I mean, Station 357,' was the reply. 'Like I said, this time o' day, shouldn't take us more'n a half-hour.'
It was still half an hour more than Rowlands would have liked, but there was nothing he could do about it. 'Are there Americans at Duxford now?' he asked --- not that he really cared one way or the other, but talking helped to take his mind off other matters. 'Sure are,' said the sergeant. '8th Air Force took command of the post earlier this month. Flying daylight  missions. Not like your boys.' He let out a whistle, part admiring, part incredulous. 'Night flying. Wouldn't get me on that racket, no, siree. I like to see where I'm heading.'
Rowlands agreed that, were he to be offered the choice, he too would have preferred to fly in daylight. Although he guessed that the dangers would be the same, whether one could see where one was going, or not. 'Which part of the United States do you come from?' he asked. 'Chicago, Illinois,' was the reply. 'And won't I be glad to get back there, when this tour's done... Not that I don't like it over here,' he added conscious that he might have sounded ungracious to one of his English 'hosts'. 'Your English pubs are mighty fine. We don't have anything like 'em back home. The people are pretty friendly, too, most of the time. But...' For a moment his voice faltered, so that he sounded like a different person --- younger, less confident --- from the brash young fellow he'd seemed to be up to now. 'I miss my Mom,' he said. 'And...' Again he broke off. 'Well, it's just not the same here, and that's a fact.'
'I think we all miss the place we come from, when we're away,' said Rowlands. 'You'll be back there before too long, I'm sure.' Hoping, as he said it, that this would prove to be the case for homesick Sergeant Clancy.

The jeep dropped him off at the gate --- which was as far as the USAF man could go without a permit, he said apologetically. As it was, he was bending the rules, transporting non-service personnel in a military vehicle, even though the Major had kinda authorised it... 'That's fine,' said Rowlands. 'I know my way from here.' Although without his dog, and with few people around at that hour of the morning to guide him, he supposed he would have to fall back on instinct and memory to find his way onto the airfield. But there was nothing else for it. Besides which, he needed Clancy to take a message to Station 43. 'Just tell whoever you speak to there that Lieutenant Wawrzkowicz is to come to Mildenhall as fast as he can. It's about Anne. He'll know,' he added.
'OK, got it,' said the airman, as Rowlands got out. 'This Vatch-ko-vitch guy's to come to Mildenhall right away, on account of this dame, Anne...'
'My daughter.'
'Got you.' And with that, Sergeant Clancy drove off, leaving Rowlands to make his way to the gate.

### Chapter Sixteen ###

In spite of his brave words to the young American, Rowlands knew it would be a far from easy matter to find his way unassisted to where he wanted to go. From previous visits to the airfield, he judged it was about a quarter of a mile from the main gate to the first group of buildings, which housed the administrative offices; then a further half-mile to the Technical Site, which included the workshops and hangars; then behind this the airfield proper, with its landing strips and control tower. He'd had all this described to him by Anne, that time --- now almost a month ago --- when she'd taken him to her barracks, located with all the others on the Domestic Site. Here were the mess halls for airmen and NCOs, medical facilities and other units essential to the running of a large military encampment.
Anne might be anywhere in this maze --- whose vast acreage would make it near-impossible to search on foot, even if he had time on his side, which he did not. A bicycle would have been the obvious way of getting around, as it was for many service personnel... except that Rowlands hadn't ridden a bike since before the last war, when he still had his sight --- and wasn't confident in his ability to do so now. All the while he deliberated, time was slipping away, while his daughter remained in danger... Oh damn and blast young whatever-his-name-was, and his reckless driving, he thought, knowing he was being unfair. The lad hadn't deliberately driven into that army jeep --- nor had he deserved the broken arm that had resulted. But if it hadn't been for that, they'd have been at Mildenhall two hours ago.
At the gate, he encountered a further setback. The sentry on duty was a new man, who set his face stonily against the idea of allowing this stranger to enter RAF territory. 'I'm afraid I've no authority to allow civilians onto the base.' 
'Then get some, can't you?' cried the exasperated Rowlands, knowing he didn't present a very respectable appearance, with his bruised and bloodied face, and his clothes torn and dirty. 'Group Captain Forrester knows me.'
'The group captain's not on the base at present.' 
Rowlands remembered what Anne had said, about the married officers living out. 'Then... try somebody else,' he said. 'Squadron Leader Templeton'll remember me.' There was of course another name he might have mentioned, but he drew back from doing so. That man, even if he were contactable, would no doubt do everything in his power to obstruct Rowlands's entry to the airfield. 
The guard hesitated; then appeared to cave in. 'I'll telephone the Guard Room.' 
'Be quick about it, can't you?' said Rowlands --- an exhortation which only had the opposite effect from the one he wanted, as, with what seems excruciating slowness, the man dialled the number and, when at last the call was answered, spoke: ''Morning, Sarge. Yes, it is a parky one... No... nothing special. It's just that...' Here, he lowered his voice, but Rowlands caught enough of the one-sided conversation through the open door of the hut to catch its drift. 'Got a right one 'ere... civilian... looks a bit the worse for wear... says he knows the group captain... Orright, Sarge. I'll ask...' The speaker broke off abruptly. 'What name was it again?' he said, directing this enquiry at Rowlands. The latter told him --- adding, with a growing sense of futility, 'Can't I talk to your sergeant? It really is urgent.'
But this was ignored. Further exchanges followed, as Rowlands waited in an agony of impatience, aware that, with every passing minute, Anne's life might be in greater danger. At last, the interminable back-and-forth drew to a close: 'OK, Sarge... Wilco... Keep him here till then, shall I?' Replacing the receiver, the guard turned to Rowlands. 'My sergeant says as you're to report to the Guard Room,' he said stiffly. 'He's sending someone to escort you.' And get you out of my hair, was the unspoken comment. 'But...' Rowlands knew it was useless to protest. He'd have to go through with whatever procedures these representatives of officialdom thought fit. If he could only get through to Forrester...            
Then, just when he had almost given up hope of ever getting onto the base, there came the purr of an engine, and a moment later, a car drew up. A voice Rowlands had heard only a few hours before said, 'Come on, Constable. Look lively and open the gate. I've a date with that kite of mine. Test flight. She won't wait forever, you know.'
'Sorry, sir. Just waiting on the Guard Room. Escort for this civilian...' He pronounced the word with some disdain. 'I'll open the gate directly, sir.'
But the driver of the car caught had sight of Rowlands. 'Oh, it's you again,' he said. 'Funny how we keep running into one another...'
'Yes,' said Rowlands. 'Listen. It's very important. You've got to help me.'
'And why should I do that?' was the cool reply.
'Because, Mr Moncrieff, Anne's life may be at stake.'
The other hesitated only a second. 'All right. Get in,' he said; then to the sentry: 'He's with me. You can let us through, Constable.' 
As the car --- an MG roadster --- roared off along the perimeter road, Moncrieff said, 'You'd better tell me what this is all about.'
Rowlands hesitated only a moment. He had no choice but to trust the young flight lieutenant, despite the fact that, until very recently, he too had been a suspect. 'Anne was at the meeting at your father's house last night.'
'You mean that National Resurgence thing?'
'Yes. She was last seen being taken away from the house by someone who was also at that meeting...' Rowlands named him.
'I don't believe it.'
'I can assure you, it's true. And we've reason to believe he's one of the ringleaders, working to bring England down...'
'That's terrible. And you're telling me he's one of ours? Betraying the Service like that. It's unthinkable.' Moncrieff was silent a moment; then: 'Even if it's true, how did Anne get mixed up in all this?'
'I think she must have overheard something incriminating... something that linked our man to the murders we've been investigating.'
'You can't be serious.'
'I'm afraid I am.' 
'So you think he killed Jonny... and that Pryce fellow?'
'I do.'
Moncrieff swore under his breath. 'I knew there was something funny going on! If only I'd said something at the time... It was just when Jonny told me what he suspected... I... I didn't take it seriously...'
'You mean about the conspiracy to steal the H2S?'
'How the hell do you know about that?
'I know, that's all. And there's isn't time to discuss it now. We've got to find my daughter, before it's too late.' 
  'So you're saying he's brought her here?'
'I think so,' said Rowlands. 'Unfortunately, I was delayed, getting to Mildenhall. I just hope I'm not too late. If anything's happened to her...'
'Look!' said Moncrieff excitedly, forgetting that this was an impossibility for his companion. 'That must be his car --- over by the hangars. The Alvis. He's left the lights on. Must've been in a hurry. Battery'll be as flat as a pancake.'
But Rowlands paid no attention to this remark, all his thoughts focused on the single fact that, if the car were there, Anne could not be far away. 'Can you see them?' he cried. 'For God's sake man --- concentrate!'
Moncrieff brought the MG to a stop. 'Can't see a thing in this light. We'll get a better look once we're at the dispersals.' He got out of the car. 'Come on!' Needing no further encouragement, Rowlands scrambled out of the MG after him, and the two --- walking briskly at first, then breaking into a run --- reached the area where the planes were lined up, within minutes. Here, the Lancs waited to be loaded up with the bombs they would carry on that evening's mission. Before that, however, they would have to be 'fettled' by the 'erks', said Moncrieff, using the now-familiar RAF argot. 
And indeed, as they drew near, Rowlands became conscious of other activity taking place around him: trucks pulling up, and maintenance crews disembarking to begin their day's work. Moncrieff exchanged terse greetings with one or two of these men --- ''Morning. Cold enough for you?' 'It is that, sir...' --- before reaching his own machine. 'D-Donald' was scheduled for a test flight that morning, and the team of fitters were already hard at work, carrying out a series of checks for faults or damage, before the plane could be passed as safe to fly. 'We got hit by a bit of flak on the last mission,' said Moncrieff. 'Might need some patching up before I can take her up again.'
Rowlands was barely listening. 'Can you see them?' he said urgently. The answer was in the negative; then Moncrieff said, 'Hello! That's odd...'
'What is?'
But the flight lieutenant didn't reply. Instead, he addressed another of the ground crew: 'Seen Flight Lieutenant Raikes about?'
'Can't say as I have, sir.'
'Only C-Charlie's door's open...'
'So it is, sir. Must've been left unlocked. Careless, very. Want me to go and close it, sir?'
'No, don't bother. I'll do it,' said Moncrieff. 'That might be where he's hiding out,' he added in an undertone to Rowlands. 'Let's take a look, shall we?' The latter needed no second bidding to follow the flight lieutenant to where the plane was standing, further along the line of enormous machines. 'Stick by me,' muttered the young man, as they ducked under the wing of C-Charlie. 'And mind your head... Yes, looks as if it wasn't properly closed,' he said in a louder tone, perhaps intended to carry; adding in an undertone: 'If I give you a leg-up, do you think you can make it?'
'Yes. Look here, Moncrieff --- we've got to stop him...'
'It's OK,' said the other softly. 'As soon as you're in, I'm going to radio the Control Tower from my plane. Let them know what's up.'
'Good man. I can't thank you enough.'
'No need. If he's here, we'll catch him, never fear.'
And with that, he bent his back so that Rowlands could get enough height to reach the open door of the aircraft. With a tremendous effort, he hauled himself up, ending face down on the floor, where he took a moment to catch his breath. As he did so, he inhaled the Lancaster's distinctive smell: engine oil, and the acrid tang of cordite, mingled with a faint cloacal whiff from the Elsan lavatory. Behind him, he heard Moncrieff slide the door shut. 
Getting to his feet, he cocked his head; listening. But there was nothing. Had he got it wrong? Maybe the plane was as deserted as it seemed. Then he heard the voices --- too far away to distinguish clearly --- but definitely emanating from the front of the plane. He edged towards the sound, feeling his way along the fuselage, and taking care not to fall over any obstacles or bang his head on projecting equipment.
Even so, his cautious approach didn't stop him from barking his shins on the wing-spar that traversed the body of the plane. How narrow the interior was! He could only imagine what it must feel like when its crew of seven climbed on board, hampered, as they would be, by thickly padded clothing and heavy boots --- to say nothing of the parachutes they would have to stow in the body of the plane until such time as these were needed. Cautiously, he manoeuvred his way past what must be a casualty station, with a fold-down bed on which a wounded crew member might be given first-aid. Then came a second wing-spar. He climbed over it, and found himself in another section --- this one (his exploring figures found), fitted with radio equipment.
The voices were getting louder. Now he could make out two distinct speakers. A man and a woman... He strained his ears to hear --- but there were still too many obstacles in the way. Another compartment --- the navigator's realm, evidently --- with a stool and table, on which stood a lamp, pencils and a pair of compasses. Reaching to steady himself on the table, he nearly knocked these to the floor... Then, as he edged his way past all this, he almost fell over something that was lying just in front of him. Something... or someone? His stomach gave a sickening lurch, as he realised that it was the body of a man, sprawled face-down on the floor of the aircraft. Dead? Or only unconscious? He felt for a pulse --- was there a weak thread of life, there? He hadn't time to investigate further.   
Because the voices were clearer, now. One he recognised as that of the man he'd come to find: '... so you see, my dear, I'm afraid I don't have any choice. Your meddling in matters you don't understand has brought you to this.'
'Oh, but I do understand,' said the other voice. Rowlands' heart leapt: it was Anne's. 'I was at that meeting, remember? I heard enough, before I was slipped that Mickey Finn, to know what you're planning --- you and the rest of your National Resurgence cronies.'
'And what's that?' The voice was cold. Even though he couldn't but admire his daughter's bravado, Rowlands hoped she'd have the sense to say nothing more. But he should've known her better than that. 'Why, the elimination of the Jews --- and anyone else who might stand in the way of your pact with the Nazi enemy,' she said.
The other laughed. 'You realise that that includes you, my dear Miss Rowlands?'
'I've gathered as much,' was the defiant reply. 'Otherwise why would you have brought me here?'
'A very good question. And one to which there can only be one answer. You and I are going for a little flight --- just as far as the English Channel, you know. Unfortunately, only one of us will return from that excursion. Below where you are sitting is the front-gunner's turret. In the floor of that turret is an escape hatch. It is through that useful aperture that you will make your descent, so to speak... Oh, don't think you can escape,' added the hateful voice. 'Those ropes are securely tied. You'll only be released just before your... well, final release, if you follow me? So don't waste your strength trying to undo those knots.'
'People know I'm here,' said Anne. 'You'll have to explain to them what's happened to me.'
'I doubt that,' said her abductor. 'When you fail to turn up at your barracks later today, it will be assumed that you've run off to be with that Polish renegade of yours... Oh, I know all about Mr Wawrzkowicz! A man like that, who's killed twice already, wouldn't scruple to dispose of a tiresome young woman, whose presence threatens to jeopardise his own escape.'
'You scoundrel,' said Anne. 
'Now, now,' replied the infuriating voice. 'Remember that you're addressing a senior officer! I could have you put on a charge for insubordination, if I weren't about to eliminate you.'
'I think not,' said Rowlands, stepping forward. His daughter let out a gasp. 'Daddy! How on earth...'
But the man who was holding her hostage wasn't so easily disconcerted. 'Get back!' he snarled. 'Or it'll be the worse for her. You'll have to take my word for it, of course, but I've got a loaded side-arm here, and I won't hesitate to use it. She'll go first, then you. So don't try anything clever, Mr Rowlands.'
'You're mad if you think you can get away with this,' said Rowlands. 'Not mad. Only clear-sighted,' was the reply. 'When England falls --- which she assuredly will --- those of us who have worked to bring about the new order will be well-placed to take over the reins of power. The government. The army... and yes, the airforce... will need leaders of vision.'
'Nazi stooges, you mean,' said Anne.
'What a very limited idea you have of the world,' sneered her captor. 'One might have expected it, in one of the older generation, but it's disappointing, coming from a young person.'
'My father's right. You are mad.'
'Shut up! Another word from you and I'll put a bullet in that pretty head of yours. As for you,' he added to Rowlands. 'Keep your hands where I can see them. And sit down until I can deal with you properly. The floor will have to do, since Miss Rowlands is occupying the flight engineer's seat. We'll be taking off in a few moments. Fortunately,' he went on, 'we won't be reaching an altitude where we'll require oxygen masks. It'll be a short trip to the coast and then...' He laughed. A chilling sound. '"Goodnight Vienna", as they say.'
'You killed young Bly,' said Rowlands --- hoping that by getting the man to talk about what he'd done, he might buy some more time. Surely Moncrieff's message to the Control Tower would have got through by now? 'Was he involved in your schemes too?'
The other, intent on carrying out some technical manoeuvre, barely troubled to reply. 'Hardly. The silly young fool overheard me talking to Pryce about a little matter we had in hand...'
'You were planning to steal the plans for the H2S Mark II,' put in Rowlands.  
'Ah, you know about that, do you? Not that your knowledge will prevent those documents from ending up in the hands of my German associates. They already have the Mark I, so it won't take them long to perfect this version. It'll be a real boost to their war effort.'
Anne gave a contemptuous snort, which the speaker ignored. 
'Yes, young Bly threatened to "shop" me to the powers-that-be for alleged treason. I had to have him silenced, of course.' Again came that inhuman chuckle. 'Walter Pryce did that job for me. Loyal fellow, Pryce. Although he had to be got rid of, in the end. Got too greedy. Thought he could run things this own way. A foolish mistake.'
'You tried to put the blame for Jonny's death on Jan Wawrzkowicz,' said Anne, cutting across this. 'Oh, that wasn't my doing! Your Polish friend managed that all by himself... with a little help from you, my dear. Convinced even Bly's closest friend that he'd been murdered in a jealous rage.' He laughed. 'Yes, that was a bit of luck for me! With Haverstock's boy on my side, as it were --- believing that his chum had been done in by the Polish renegade in a stupid quarrel over a girl --- no one was going to suspect anyone else, least of all a senior member of Bomber Command... Although he --- young Moncrieff --- turned out a bit of a disappointment, in the end. Turned me down flat when I tried to interest him in our movement. One would have thought the son of a father such as his might have had more of a sense of vision... However, it was not to be.' He was silent a moment, as reflecting on what might have been.
'You traitor,' said Anne. 'I don't know how you can bring yourself to betray your country... to say nothing of the Service.' It was an echo of what Moncrieff had said. But the man to whom she'd spoken with such contempt seemed remarkably unruffled. 'It all depends which way you look at it,' he replied. 'What you call treachery, is to me the highest form of patriotism. By betraying your "Service", as you put it, I am doing no more than advancing my own --- and in the process saving this benighted country from a worse enemy...' As he spoke, there came a crackle of static from the pilot's radio headset. 'C-Charlie... C-Charlie... Do you read me?'
'Damn fools,' he muttered. 'By the time they work out what's going on, it'll be too late to stop me.'
'C-Charlie... C-Charlie... Come in please...'
'No chance of that...'
'C-Charlie... C-Charlie... Permission to take off denied... repeat... denied...'
With an oath, the pilot disconnected the radio. 'Enough talk. I'm going to start the engines now --- just as poor Flight Lieutenant Raikes would have started them, had he been fit to do so...' He gave what might have been a regretful laugh, as if he had not been the one responsible for putting Raikes out of action. 'While I am thus engaged, you had better not try anything foolish, Mr Rowlands. Be aware that --- temporarily occupied as I will be --- it will be a matter of seconds for me to shoot your daughter. Any false move from you will be her last.'
'Let her go,' said Rowlands, suspecting, as he made it, that this plea would have little effect. The other didn't even dignify it with a reply. Instead, he focused his attention on starting up the first of the four engines, which burst into life with a loud whirring. The second followed suit. Then the third. Finally the fourth --- until the cockpit vibrated with the sound, making further talk impossible. It was then that Rowlands thought about making a grab for the gun. But it was too risky. He didn't doubt for a moment that any last-minute heroics on his part might result in his own death --- and worse, that of his daughter.
The Lancaster began to taxi slowly along the approach path to the runway, getting into position, Rowlands guessed, for takeoff. He recalled this much from his one experience of being a passenger in a light aircraft, before the war. You started slowly, but it wasn't long before you picked up speed... And indeed, as the Lanc began to accelerate along the runway, the sound of the engines changed from the low droning that had formed the background to the past few minutes, to a high-pitched note. 
Crouched on the floor as he was, Rowlands felt the vibration throughout his entire body, so that his teeth seems to rattle in his head. It struck him that, with his opponent now concentrating on getting the plane airborne, this might be the best moment for an attack. But as he coiled himself for a spring, the hateful voice said, 'Remember what I said, Mr Rowlands. I can still reach the gun faster than you can.'
In that moment it seems to Rowlands that they were lost. All that remained for him and Anne was an ignominious death, thrown from an aeroplane into the sea, from which their bodies might never be recovered...
Then, just as he had given up hope, another sound cut across the whine of the engines. This was a deeper note --- a roar --- as of heavy vehicles, and came from the runway outside. It was accompanied by the clanging of alarm bells. 'What the hell?' shouted the pilot. 'I don't believe it! The bloody fools! What are they playing at? They'll kill us all...'
Then it seemed that he must have lost control of the plane, because a moment later, there came a violent jolt, that made the whole fuselage shudder. Rowlands himself was flung forward, his body slamming into the bank of fuel gauges and switches that lay in front of him. In the same moment, Anne screamed. But what she said next made no sense to him. 'The fire trucks!' she cried. 'They've sent the fire-trucks! Oh thank God! Thank God!'

### Chapter Seventeen ###

Rowlands hadn't time to think what this might mean --- and barely time to register that the plane had now come to a juddering halt --- before having to confront another development. Because even if their captor's plan had evidently been thwarted --- in what way exactly he wasn't able to ascertain --- they weren't out of danger yet. As the blind man struggled to sit upright, feeling a trickle of blood run down his face from a freshly-opened cut, he heard Anne cry out again --- and this time the sound wasn't that of relief but of fear. 'No! Let go of me! You... you monster!'    
  'Shut up! You're coming with me,' snarled the other. At which Rowlands, sensing that this might be his last chance, hurled himself at the man. For a moment or two, they grappled together in the narrow passageway that led from the cockpit to the body of the plane. Then a stunning blow to the side of his head from the butt of the gun sent him sprawling. 
He supposed he must have blacked-out for a moment, because the next thing he knew, he was alone. Anne and her captor had gone. Shaking his head from side to side to dispel the nausea that threatened to overwhelm him, Rowlands got to his feet, and began make his way back along the plane --- pausing only to check the condition of the unconscious Flight Lieutenant Raikes. Was the man breathing still? His cheek felt cold... but it didn't seem like the icy chill of death... 'Hang on,' he murmured, in the unlikely event that the other could hear him. 'Help's on its way...'
Reaching the door, he slid it open, and, bracing himself for the impact, began lowering himself to the ground. At once, he heard a shout --- 'Over here!' --- and a moment later, felt himself assisted by willing hands. 'You OK, sir? That's a nasty cut you've got there...'
'I'm fine,' he said. 'But there's a man in need of urgent medical attention on board the aircraft. See to him, will you? I've got to find my daughter. Can you point me towards the hangars?'
The man who'd helped him did so... unless it was another man. There seemed to be a lot of people milling about, he thought. A general mood of excitement prevailed. 'Didyer see it? Missed 'em by a whisker, it did...' 
'Coo! what a smash-up that would've bin... Four fire-trucks flattened by a bloomin' Lanc...'    
Rowlands hadn't time to listen to any more of it. But as began walking rapidly in the direction indicated, restraining himself from breaking into a run only because he knew the likelihood of running into some obstacle was very high, he  heard himself hailed: 'Hi! Mr Rowlands! Wait a minute, can't you?' It was Moncrieff, sounding out of breath --- as if he'd run quite a distance, which in fact he had. 'What's happened? Did you find them?'
'Yes...' There wasn't time to explain. 'Didn't you see them?'
'No. I...'
'Well, come on --- don't just stand there!' shouted Rowlands, his anger at the young man being no more than displaced anger at himself. 'And watch out. He's armed.' Then neither said anything more, both intent on reaching the hangars --- and the car that might by now already be making its getaway --- in the fastest possible time. For Rowlands everything else was subsumed in the here-and-now: the feel of the coarse grass under his feet; his pounding heart; the smell of spilt fuel and scorched rubber drifting from the runway... 'It was you,' he panted. 'You organised the fire-trucks...'
'Yes. It was the only way I could think of to stop him, after he ignored the order to abort takeoff.'
'I owe you a debt of thanks --- and an apology.'
'No need for that.'
There was no time to say more, because they were back where they'd started --- could it have been only an hour ago? --- in front of the hangars, where they'd left Moncrieff's MG --- and where the other car had been parked. That this was having trouble starting was evident from the ugly rasp of the ignition being fired, again and again --- without result --- and of the choke being applied, also ineffectively. A stream of curses issued from the open-topped Alvis. 'Get back, you!' shouted the driver of the vehicle, when he spotted his pursuers. 'Or it'll be the worse for her.'
'Let her go,' cried Rowlands. 'You know the game's up.'
'Not quite.' Because just at that moment the engine burst into life, and the roadster began to move off along the exit road towards the gate. 'Stop!' shouted Rowlands, knowing it was futile. 'We've got to go after them,' he said to Moncrieff. The latter was already starting his own car. 'Get in.' Once more they set off in pursuit. 'We'll cut them off at the gate,' shouted Rowlands, above the drone of the engine. But it was as they reached the end of the approach road, that there came another sound: a roaring, like that of a fighter aircraft. Ahead of them, the Alvis came to a screeching halt. 'My God!' cried Moncrieff. 'He's done it! Stopped him dead in his tracks...'
Quite who he was referring to, or who it was the former had 'stopped' only became clear a moment later, when the roaring sound --- which Rowlands now identified as that of a powerful motorbike --- rose to a crescendo, then died abruptly. A voice Rowlands knew shouted, 'Now I've got you, you bastard!'
'That's what you think!' There was the sound of a shot. A scream from Anne. Then another shot, followed by a yelp of agony. 'Jan! No!' It was Anne who'd shouted. Rowlands felt his heart give a leap. She must be all right, then...
'Hello, my dear. I was only going to serve him --- this traitor ---  the way he would have served me,' said Jan Wawrzkowicz. 'Since you do not wish it, I will spare him, scoundrel that he is... Get up, you,' he added to the stricken man. 'You will not die of a mere flesh-wound.'
Alerted by the sounds of shooting, men were running from the Guard Room. 'What's all this, then?' demanded the man who seemed to be in charge --- perhaps the sergeant to whom Rowlands was to have reported before Moncrieff had come to the rescue... 'Why, Wing Commander Hawkins, sir, you're hurt... Call the MO, at once, Constable,' he ordered his subordinate. 'The Wing Commander needs medical attention...'
'Sir.'
 'And you can drop your weapon, sunshine,' the sergeant said to Wawrzkowicz. 'Or I'll know the reason why.'
'You've got this all wrong...' began Rowlands --- but the MP paid no attention. 'You're under arrest,' he went on, still addressing the Polish fighter. 'For attempted murder.'
'You're arresting the wrong man, Sergeant,' said Moncrieff. 'Mr Wawrzkowicz here was the innocent party in the exchange of fire.'
'Ho, it's the Polish feller, is it?' said the sergeant. 'I know all about him. We've been looking for you for quite a while, Mr... er... whatever your name is. Take him in charge, Constable,' he said to another of his officers.
There was a breathless moment while the accused man considered this; then he threw down his gun. 'I know you think it best for me to give myself up,' he said to Anne. 'And so I am doing so. But only because you ask it.'
'Jan. Darling.' She ran to him. 'I won't let them take you away.'
'Now then,' said the sergeant. 'You'd better stand aside, Miss...'
But at that moment, there came the sound of an engine spluttering into life. Taking advantage of the distraction brought about by Wawrzkowicz's arrest, Hawkins --- wounded as he was --- was making his getaway. Before any of them could react, the Alvis roared past, scattering gravel, and was out through the gate. 'Stop him!' shouted Rowlands. 'He's your murderer, you fools!'
There was a moment's electrified silence; then a confusion of voices arose. The sergeant gave vent to an oath, then shouted for someone to fetch him a car; the constable who'd been about to arrest Wawrzkowicz fell back, muttering that he didn't rightly know what he ought to do, he really didn't. Moncrieff said impatiently that, if nobody else was going to take action, then he'd better go after the man, before the latter got clean away. 'You're needed here, Flight Lieutenant,' said Rowlands --- because it struck him that they'd need an independent witness to what had transpired during the past hour and a half, if Wawrzkowicz was to be exonerated. 
In the midst of this pandemonium, there came the sound of a staff car drawing up. An impatient voice shouted, 'Isn't somebody going to open this blasted gate?' Then, when this failed to produce an immediate response: 'I said, open up, damn you! What the blazes is going on?'

'I find it hard to believe that Hawkins could have been a traitor,' said Group Captain Forrester. 'He was a fine pilot, you know. Flew over forty missions before his promotion to wing commander. Risked his life on numerous occasions to bring his crew back safely. Hard to believe he was plotting to bring about the destruction of those same men --- and of the country. And yet...' He was silent a moment. 'With hindsight, there were times when things he said or did seemed odd, to say the least. There was his adamant refusal to take part in that film, for example. At the time, I thought it was just stubbornness, but...'
'He was afraid he might be identified as an enemy agent,' said Rowlands. 'If his connection with RAF Mildenhall was too widely known, he'd become useless as a source to the other side.'
'And then he was so keen to pin the blame for young Bly's murder on you, Mr Wawrzkowicz,' went on Forrester; adding, in a rather embarrassed tone, 'I'm afraid I allowed myself to be persuaded against my better judgement.'
'You weren't alone, sir,' said Moncrieff. 'I owe you an apology,' he added to the Polish fighter. 'Allowing myself to be blinded by prejudice instead of looking at the facts.'
'Bly was your friend,' replied Wawrzkowicz. 'One is never impartial where friendship is concerned.'
'What I don't understand is why he killed young Bly,' said the group captain. 'The lad could have been no danger to him, surely?'
'Bly overheard Hawkins talking to Walter Pryce about the theft of the H2S documents' said Rowlands. 'Being a navigator, he of course understood what it was all about...'
 'Now I think of it, Hawkins did take a particular interest in the H2S,' put in Forrester. 'Kept on asking me when the Mark II would be ready  and how soon we were likely to deploy it in our aircraft. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now it seems all of a piece with what you've been telling me. Shocking, that such things should happen on my watch --- and at my airfield. Treachery. Murder. It doesn't bear thinking about...'
'That must have been what Jonny meant, that time in the pub, when he said that there was some "funny business" going on at Mildenhall' interrupted Anne. 'At the time, I just put it down to the blues, but now I see that he was trying to warn me about whatever it was he'd found out.' She shivered slightly. 'He said something about a list...' 
'A list of those to be assassinated,' said Rowlands. 'Bly must have recognised one of the names. He knew he'd have to get a warning to that person before it was too late...'
'But he was killed first,' said Moncrieff; adding softly, 'Poor Jonny. He tried to warn me about what was going on, too. If only I'd listened to him...'
The door opened. 'What's all this I hear about one of my girls being carried off in a stolen plane?' said a voice. It was the Hellcat. 'Not the kind of thing I expect of you, Aircraftwoman Rowlands! As for that get-up you're wearing... when did an evening frock and flying jacket become standard wear for service personnel? Let's get you back to barracks and into something more suitable, PDQ.'
'Yes, Section Leader,' said Anne.
'Incorrect dress aside, you don't look any the worse for your jaunt,' observed Miss Henderson. 'Unlike you, Mr Rowlands. We'd better get the MO to take a look at that cut of yours.' 
Rowlands thought it best not to object. Where this formidable woman was concerned, it was simpler to agree with everything she said. 
'I suppose you must be the man that all the fuss has been about?' said Section Leader Henderson, turning her attention to Wawrzkowicz, who agreed that this was so. 'Leading us all a merry dance,' she said, with a disapproving sniff. 'And then nearly causing an accident with that motorbike of yours... Oh, I've heard all about it. Silly schoolboy heroics, if you ask me. I should have thought you'd have had more sense than to get mixed up in such stuff,' she added to Anne, who murmured something unintelligible.
'Well, come along, then, Aircraftwoman. You'd better say your goodbyes and get back to work.' Anne accordingly took a hurried leave of her father and fiancé. There was silence when the two women had gone. 'If there's nothing more you want from me, sir, I'd better be getting back to work, too,' said Moncrieff at last. 'There's a plane and some fire-trucks to be returned to their proper places.'
'Yes, see about it, Flight Lieutenant,' said Forrester gruffly. 'As long as everything's back where it should be by this afternoon's briefing, I'll waive the official reprimand.'
'Sir.'  The young man saluted and then turned to go. But something --- or somebody stopped him. 'Thanks,' said Wawrzkowicz, holding out his hand. Moncrieff shook it. 'Don't mention it,' he said. It struck Rowlands that he had been wrong about the young flier --- allowing prejudice to blind him, just as Moncrieff himself, by his own account, had been blinded by prejudice towards Wawrzkowicz. The latter now appeared to shake himself out of his momentary fit of abstraction. 'I, too, must go,' he said. 'In all the excitement, I neglected to ask permission to leave Station 43.'
'Then I hope Colonel Pennington tears you off a strip,' said Forrester, but he was smiling as he said it. 'Goodbye, Mr Wawrzkowicz --- and good luck.'
The Polish airman and the group captain shook hands, and then the former turned to Rowlands. 'I am glad you have suffered no more than a few cuts and bruises, Mr Rowlands,' he said. 'It might have been much worse. I did warn you that you were up against dangerous people.' 
'So you did.'
'Although if you had not been there, I do not like to think what might have happened to Anne,' said the young man gravely. 'It was as well that your American friend got the message to me when he did.'
'What's this?' said Group Captain Forrester. 'I wasn't aware that the Yanks were mixed up in this...'
'I'll explain later,' said Rowlands. 'Goodbye, Jan. I hope this means that your own troubles --- as regards the leaking of confidential information --- are now at an end?'
'As it happens...' began Wawrzkowicz; but before he could enlarge on this, there came the sound of a vehicle --- a police Wolseley --- pulling up outside. A moment later, voices were heard in the outer office --- one of them blessedly familiar to Rowlands. 'Whurr is he? Whurr's the blighter?' Alasdair Douglas's Midlothian accent grew more pronounced, the more excited he was. The door burst open and the man himself came in, followed by his sergeant. 'Fred! Ye look a sight an' no mistake!' cried the superintendent. 'Whut's all that blood on your face, mon?'
'It looks worse than it is,' said his friend.
'Ye're lucky ye weren't kilt. An' whut's all this I hear about planes being hijacked and yersel' and the lassie being taken hostage?'
'Well...' began Rowlands; but the other hadn't yet had his say. 'Not only that, but ye let the culprit slip through yer fingers, I gather?'
'That wasn't Mr Rowlands' fault,' said Jan Wawrzkowicz. 'If anyone was to blame, it was I.'
'Och, so ye're the feller the police o' four counties have been chasing?' said Douglas. 'Mister War-ko-witz, I presume? A fine dance ye've led us, laddie, an' no mistake. I take it,' he added, now addressing the group captain, 'that all charges of murrda against this gentleman have been dropped?'
Forrester confirmed that this was so. 'Hmph,' said the superintendent. 'I suppose that's one less headache for the police. But it seems we still have a missing suspect --- only not the one we originally thought. Which is lucky for you, Mr Wawrzkowicz.'
'Oh, luck has nothing to do with it,' said the young man airily. 'Goodbye, gentlemen.' With that he went out and, a moment later, they heard his motorbike roar off.
'Cocky young devil,' said the policeman, with a certain grudging approval. 'Let's hope whatever passes for "luck" with him holds out... So. To business. A car answering to the description of the one driven by our Mr Hawkins passed through Cambridge about an hour ago, and then vanished from sight a short while after. We're checking railway stations along the route to London, o'course --- as well as the airfields --- but we've had no sign o' him yet.'
'He's wounded, isn't he?' said Forrester. 'Not much chance of his flying a plane with a bullet in the shoulder --- even if he could get past security...'
'Aye, we think he'll probably try and lie low for a wee while, until he can get medical attention. He'll need money, too, o'course, if he's planning to fly the coop. My guess is he'll have taken refuge with friends. Somewhere safe, where he can plan his next move...and change his appearance, into the bargain.'
'I've an idea where he might have gone,' said Rowlands.

### Chapter Eighteen ###

The house in Belgrave Square was silent and dark --- in sharp contrast to the way it had been not twenty-four hours before. 'Quiet as the grave it is now,' said Douglas, as the police car pulled up in front. 'Ye'd never ha' thought that a few hours ago it was full o' noise and people... some of 'em plotting the downfall o' the British government,' he added grimly. 'All right, Fred. Let's see if your hunch was right, and the dog's returned to his vomit, so to speak...'
But when the door was eventually opened --- after repeated jangling of the bell --- the butler said his master was not available. 'His Lordship will be departing imminently for his estates in Scotland,' he told the superintendent and his companions. 'The house is to be shut up for the duration.'
'I don't care about all that,' replied Douglas roughly. 'I'll speak to his lordship now --- or he can accompany me to Scotland Yard. It doesn't matter to me --- but it might to him.'
A door at the far end of the hall in which they were standing opened. 'What is all this, Partridge?' said a peevish voice. 'I really can't have this commotion going on when I'm trying to prepare myself for a journey... Oh it's you, Inspector,' he added flatly, on seeing his uninvited guests. 'If it's about that young woman who's gone missing, I've already told you all I know.'
'Nevertheless, my lord, I must insist on carrying out a search o' the premises,' said Douglas, in a tone that brooked no refusal. 'I must ask ye furthermore, to delay your journey until I have done so.'
'This is preposterous!' snapped Haverstock. 'I tell you, the girl isn't here!'
'It isn't the young lady I'm looking for just now,' was the reply. 'But another of your guests on Saturday night... a certain Derek Hawkins. Wing Commander Hawkins, that is. Ye ken who I mean, do ye not?'
'Vaguely,' was the off-hand reply. 'The place was swarming with people. Given his RAF rank, I imagine he must have been one of my son's acquaintances...'
'Ye were seen talking to the man afore he left the house,' said Douglas. 'He was with the young lady, Miss Rowlands, at the time.'
'It sounds rather as if the two have run off together,' retorted the aristocrat with a snort of laughter. 'In which case, why are you pestering me, I'd like to know?'
'My daughter was taken away against her will,' interjected Rowlands. 'It's no thanks to you or your friends that she's alive to tell the tale.'
'Ah, so you're the father, are you?' came the hateful, drawling voice. 'Perhaps you should take more care to keep your daughter out of scrapes? Young women do get up to all sorts of mischief these days, I'm told.'
'Why, you...'
'Be that as it may,' put in Douglas hastily, laying a restraining hand on Rowlands' arm. 'I'd like to know where you're hiding Hawkins.'
'Hiding him? I've exchanged no more than two words with him. Now you tell me I'm harbouring this fellow under my roof. Preposterous,' said Lord Haverstock again; then, to the servant. who was hovering nearby, 'All right, Partridge. You'd better tell Jenkins not to bring the car round just yet. These gentlemen...' --- he gave the word an ironic emphasis --- 'have my permission to look over the house.'
'Very good, my lord.'
'I,' said Haverstock, 'will be in my study, until such time as the Inspector has finished searching my property --- although who or what he hopes to find, God only knows... The Commissioner of Police will hear of this, I promise you,' he added, by way of a parting shot to the superintendent. 'I'm sure he'll take a dim view of your bursting into a private individual's house without a search warrant.' 
There was a moment's silence after the door had closed behind the master of the house. 'Verrae well' said Douglas. 'Let's get to it, shall we? You...' --- addressing his sergeant --- 'take the second floor. Fred, you take the first floor. I'll do the ground floor and join ye both upstairs when I've done so.'
But it was soon obvious, after a cursory search of the upper floors, that there was nobody there. Rooms which, a mere twenty-four hours before, had been filled with music and laughter, were now silent and empty --- their furniture shrouded in dust sheets, and lingering smells of cigarette smoke, perfume and champagne gone sour overlaid by those of beeswax and floor polish. As he went from one echoing chamber to another, Rowlands wondered if, after all, he'd made a mistake. It had seemed obvious to him that, having abandoned his own vehicle a mere sixty miles from London, Hawkins must have made for the nearest place of refuge --- presumably picked up by another car, since the railway stations were being watched. Where better for the fugitive than the house of the man who was --- supposedly --- the linch-pin of the National Resurgence conspiracy? Only someone with Haverstock's wealth and connections could provide the shelter, money and transport Hawkins would need.
And yet not a trace of him could they find, in all this vast mansion --- now empty of all but a skeleton staff of servants, whom Sergeant Dennison, having finished his search of the upper floors, was now given the task of questioning. The superintendent, too, had failed in his own investigations. 'No sign of anyone who hasn't a right to be here,' he said glumly. 'Although we've searched the place as thoroughly as possible. The fact is, that in a house this size, there's any number o' nooks and crannies where a man might hide himself.' 
Lord Haverstock was where he had said he'd be --- in his study. 'Found what you were looking for? No? Thought not,' he said malevolently, from his seat by the fire. 'Told you you were wasting your time. England's still a free country,' he added, as if he'd been saving up this piece of sententiousness. 'Not a police state, where one's home can be invaded on the smallest pretext...'
'That's verrae true, my lord,' said Douglas. 'Let's hope it stays that way. No thanks to you or your friends if it doesn't, eh?'
The master of the house touched a bell. 'See these people out, Partridge,' he said, when the butler appeared at this summons. 'Yes, my lord. This way, gentlemen.'
But Rowlands was now more than ever convinced that they were on the right track. 'He's here,' he said to Douglas, as the three of them exited the house --- the butler closing the door on the interlopers with pointed firmness even before they had descended the steps to the street. 'I suspected it, and now I'm sure of it.'
'If this is another of your intuitions, I'm afraid this one's let ye down,' said the superintendent sourly. 'It was a good guess, Fred. But I reckon the bird has flown. After all, there's nothing to say that Hawkins went to London, after he ditched the Alvis. Birmingham's no further from Cambridge, and more convenient for getting to Bristol and Liverpool. But never fear. We're watching the ports. He'll nae get far...'
'I tell you, he is here!' cried Rowlands, cutting across this. 'He's in that very room --- or was, until very recently...' Then, as Douglas began to object: 'It was the smell of the cigarette, just now, in Haverstock's study --- the only room we haven't searched. It's Hawkins' special mixture, made up by Bacon Bros tobacconists in Cambridge, which manufactures cigarettes to order. He's here, Douglas.'
The latter remained dubious. 'We've just searched the premises from top to bottom,' he said. 'The man's nowhere to be found. I tell ye, Fred, we'd be wasting our time, going over the place again.'
'And I'm telling you he's here,' said Rowlands. 'Probably biding his time until he's sure we've gone, before hitching a lift to Scotland in Lord Haverstock's Rolls... which is doubtless how he got here from Cambridge,' he added. 'Mebbe so,' was the reply. 'But ye heard his lordship --- he'll no' let me back in that house wi'out a search warrant... that's if I can get one. Nae doubt he's telephoning the Commissioner of Police this verrae minute to put a stop to it.'
While the two of them --- with Sergeant Dennison in mute attendance --- stood arguing about the merits or otherwise of searching the house once more, footsteps approached along the street. 'I say, it's Mr Rowlands, isn't it? Saw you at the "do" last night. Funny how we keep running into one another...'
'Hello, Mr Travers.' Inwardly, Rowlands groaned. The last thing he wanted at that moment was to get into conversation with the loquacious young pilot. 'What are you doing here? The party's over, surely?'
'I know.' The other hesitated a moment, then plunged on. 'Fact is, I got  bit "lit" last night... Jolly good party, wasn't it? Haven't drunk so much champers in ages...'
'Mr Travers,' interrupted Rowlands, conscious of Douglas's restive presence at his side. 'I'm afraid I'm in rather a hurry...'
'Right you are,' said the young man. 'Ought to be trotting along myself. Mother'll be wondering where I've got to.' He gave a short laugh. 'Can't have her ringing up the police on my account! Hasn't been too well lately, you know,' he added in a more sombre tone. 'This war gets her down...'
'I'm sorry to hear that. But now I really must...'
'So I said to her I wouldn't be long. Fortunately, it's not far to Eaton Square...'
'Mr Travers...'
'Said I'd just pop in, collect the cigarette case, and go straight home... Anyway, good to see you again, Mr Rowlands. Say hello to Anne for me, won't you?'
He was already mounting the steps to the front door when Rowlands stopped him. 'Cigarette case?' he said. Bob Travers laughed, a little sheepishly this time. 'Yes --- didn't I say? Must've dropped out of my coat pocket. Didn't notice at the time --- like I said, I was a bit worse for wear. Realised as soon as I got home. Case not there. Nice one, you know. Engraved and all that. Twenty-first birthday present. Mother'd never forgive me if I lost it...'
Rowlands put his hand on the young man's shoulder, steering him back to the street. 'A word with you, Mr Travers,' he said. 'This is what I want you to do.'
A few minutes later, Rowlands, the superintendent, and his sergeant, having made their way via the mews at the back of the property, entered the house via the basement door, which was fortuitously unlocked. Here, as attested by the junior officer, they found the cook and housemaid having a cup of tea in the kitchen with the chauffeur. 'I'm tellin' you,' the latter was saying. 'It's more'n my job's worth, to get mixed up in all this...'
'A commendable sentiment, Mr Jenkins,' said Douglas, as they walked in.  'And no, don't any of ye move. Ye're fine where ye are. Sergeant Dennison --- whom ye've already met --- will stay with ye, just in case any of ye get ideas about raising the alarm... which, believe me, will land ye in more trouble than ye can imagine. Fine-looking plum cake that,' he remarked appreciatively. 'I'm sure Sergeant Dennison'd be glad of a slice. You,' he went on, addressing the housemaid, who gave a terrified squeak, 'can show this gentleman and myself the way up the back stairs to the ground floor. But not a sound, mind, or it'll be the worse for ye...'
Thus, the two men, with the snivelling maidservant leading the way, ascended a creaking wooden staircase to the floor above. Here, a corridor led past a series of rooms of varying domestic function, ending in what Rowlands guessed must be the butler's pantry. 'All right, you can go back to your friends,' the policeman hissed to the girl, who needed no further telling. 'Through here,' he said to Rowlands, but the latter had already worked this out for himself. Because from beyond the green baize door, the sound of voices could be heard. Young Travers was evidently doing his stuff. '... so you see, if I could just take a dekko at the ballroom,' he was saying. 'I think that's where I must have dropped it, during the dancing. Easy to lose something when one's hopping about in that frightfully energetic way, you know.... Yes, it was either there, or when I was having supper in the room next to the ballroom...'
To which the unfortunate Partridge was raising what sounded like increasingly feeble objections. ('I'm sure the maids would have found it, sir, when they were tidying the rooms...')
'Not a word, my good man,' said Douglas, as he and Rowlands walked in. 'And don't touch that bell, if ye know what's good for ye. Keep an eye on him, Mr Travers, if ye will. Now then.' In two strides, he was across the hall, and opening the door of the study, where, a bare quarter of an hour before, they had been seen off with such scant ceremony by Lord Haverstock. Now the man himself leapt to his feet, with an exclamation. 'What the...?'
'You fool,' said the man who was with him. 'I might have known you'd give the game away.'
'Derek John Hawkins, I am arresting you on a charge of murdering Jonathan Julian Bly and Walter Arnold Pryce,' said the superintendent. 'And for the attempted murder of...'
'Look out!' shouted Rowlands, for his sharper hearing had picked up the sound of safety-catch being released. 'He's got a gun!' With that, he flung himself towards where he judged Hawkins to be standing --- aiming for the man's legs, with a view to toppling him. It was as well he did, for the shot, when it came, went over his head, only narrowly missing the superintendent. Rowlands' prompt action had knocked the assailant off-balance just enough to prevent another fatality being added to the latter's tally. Now, winded and bleeding from the freshly opened bullet wound in his shoulder, he lay gasping on the carpet at Rowlands' feet. 'I should have done for you when I had the chance,' he snarled. 'You've been nothing but trouble to me all along --- you and that girl of yours...'
'Anything I can do?' said a cheerful voice, as Bob Travers put his head around the door. 'I heard a shot.'
'You might tell my sergeant to come up here,' was the reply. 'He'll have had his fill o' plum cake by now.' But the officer, doubtless alerted by the same shot that had brought Travers, now appeared. 'Ah, there ye are, Dennison. Telephone Scotland Yard at once, and get them to send a Black Maria. On second thoughts,' added Douglas. 'Ye'd better make that a plain car. I don't think that we want to draw too much attention to this arrest --- wouldn't you agree, my lord?'
Haverstock said something unintelligible. But Hawkins laughed. 'That's right,' he said, and it sounded as if he was forcing the words out between clenched teeth. 'Sweep it under the carpet, the way the establishment always does when it's threatened. Only you won't find it so easy to do, once our people are in power. Then it'll be men like you --- lickspittle lackeys of a corrupt system --- who'll be swept away...'
'Hold your noise,' said Douglas. 'Ye can save it for the trial.'

'They'll hang him, of course,' said Group Captain Forrester, his tone suggesting that he took no pleasure in the statement. 'Even if it's found that he didn't kill the Bly boy, the murder will be laid at his door --- along with the Pryce killing. Quite apart from the fact that treason is a capital crime, there's the matter of his bringing the Service into disrepute...'
There was a general murmur of agreement from the men assembled in the room ---  among them Chief Constable Valentine and Inspector Strong --- who were now being debriefed about recent developments. A week had passed since the dramatic events which had led up to Wing Commander Hawkins' arrest, but the dust had not yet settled, as far as the disruption this had brought about, thought Rowlands, who was also present. 'It'll be a court martial, so none of this has to get out,' Forrester went on. 'Better for the Service,' he added. 'If word of Hawkins' treachery were to reach the general public, it could make life very difficult for the rest of us, who are trying to get on with fighting a war. Sedition!' he exclaimed disgustedly. 'One has to hope it hasn't spread...'
'Aye,' said Superintendent Douglas, who had taken this opportunity to light his pipe, and now waved the match to extinguish it, leaving a trail of acrid smoke upon the air. 'It's like a forest fire. We do our best to stamp it out, but it flares up somewhere else. The fact is,' he added gloomily, 'the real culprits --- like our noble lord there --- are the ones who are setting the fires, so to speak. But they get away scot free.'
'I'll speak for him at the court martial,' Forrester went on, ignoring this remark. 'Character reference. He was a good officer. A fine pilot. Terrible waste of all that talent. If he hadn't got drawn into all that political nonsense...'
'Has he said how it was he came to be recruited?' interrupted Rowlands. 'Or mentioned who recruited him?'
 'Not a word,' replied Douglas. 'Denies any involvement with National Resurgence or its members. Says he took refuge at Haverstock's place because the latter was a friend, nothing more.'
'That shows the calibre of the man,' said Forrester. 'As I said, a terrible waste of ability --- and a loss to the Service...'
'Which he set out to destroy from within,' the Chief Constable pointed out, with some asperity. 'Having first given away the plans of our target identification system to the Germans, he'd have moved onto other things, no doubt. Have we any idea how many RAF missions he might have compromised?'
'No,' was the succinct reply. 'And I'm not defending the man --- you know that, Ronnie. I was only saying that, had things been otherwise, he might have had a distinguished career.'
But something Valentine had said reminded Rowlands of an aspect of the case which had been troubling him. 'We know that Hawkins was giving information about RAF movements to the Germans --- and would have continued to do so, had he not been arrested. But has he admitted that he was also responsible for compromising Polish resistance missions?'
'Now you ask, the subject didn't come up,' said Douglas. 'As ye might suppose, we had enough to tax him with, wi'out bringing in our Polish allies...'
'And yet he was so eager to implicate Jan Wawrzkowicz in the murders,' said Rowlands. 'A blind, merely,' was the superintendent's reply. 'Wawrzkowicz was a convenient scapegoat. As long as the police were looking in that direction, they weren't able to see what was under their noses.'
'Yes, the Force certainly allowed itself to be bamboozled,' agree the Chief Constable ruefully. 'Although the evidence was misleading, to say the least. I for one can't blame my officers for getting hold of the wrong end of the stick. They did the best they could, in very trying circumstances.'
'Thank you sir,' said Inspector Strong, in a choked voice. 'But I take full responsibility for the mistakes that were made.'
'Och, mon, that's in the nature o' policing,' said Douglas. 'Ye'd no' get  verrae far if ye didnae make mistakes.'
'We were all guilty of that,' said the group captain. 'Myself most of all. I'll never understand,' he went on in a reflective tone, 'how a man could bring himself to betray his comrades, the way that Hawkins did. I mean, it might be argued that one's country is an abstract concept. But one's Service --- never. It's like betraying one's family,' he said.


### Chapter Nineteen ###

Having left the group captain's office, the two men, accompanied by Rowlands' dog, walked in silence towards where the superintendent's car was parked. Only when they reached the Wolseley, where Douglas's sergeant stood ready to open the door for his superior officer, did the latter speak: 'Aye,' he said. 'I reckon there'll be some head-scratching amongst my colleagues in the Force when it gets around how spectacularly they got things wrong. It's at times like these that one realises the importance of good, solid, police work as opposed to letting one's prejudices run awa' wi' one...'
'Indeed,' said Rowlands, who privately thought that the superintendent himself had not been immune from this. 'Well,' said Douglas, after a moment. 'Will I gi' ye a lift back to London, Fred? And Fido, too, o'course,' he added jovially, bending down to pat the dog, who bore this patiently. 'Seems to me he's played his part in uncovering the truth as much as any of us, haven't ye, boy?' 
Rowlands said that he'd be glad of a lift. He'd take the opportunity of being back in London to call on the Major at Regent's Park. While he would have to be circumspect in what he told his old friend about the Mildenhall affair, he could at least bring him up to date on the doings of the Brighton office --- in particular, the latest news about John Harvey... Rowlands smiled to himself as he thought of the delight with which the young man had announced his engagement to Mavis Bates, only the week before: 'She's agreed to take me on,' he'd said. 'Although I think she must need her head examining. But I'm not letting her back out of it now...' At which typically perverse way of putting things his fiancée had only laughed. Yes, she'd be good for him, thought Rowlands.
'If ye're coming, man, then get in,' said Douglas, breaking into these thoughts. 'We can stop off at that pub of yours for a bite o' lunch on the way.'
But their lunch at the King's Head was not to be, for just then Rowlands heard a shout from across the concourse: 'Hi! Mr Rowlands! Fred! I thought it was you...'
'Hello, Mr Macpherson.'
'Sandy, please!' wheezed the film director, as he hurried up. 'So glad you decided to return to Mildenhall. Couldn't have worked out better.'
'Fred,' called the superintendent from the back seat of the car. 'We're awa' the noo...'
'Oh,  you can't go yet!' cried Sandy Macpherson. 'Not when I've got things all set up for filming.'
'I thought the film was finished,' said Rowlands.
'Oh, it is! But there are always a few last-minute changes to make, you know. Small details that you probably wouldn't notice, but which will make all the difference to the final print... I particularly want to re-do some of the exterior shots,' the young man went on. 'Some of them are dreadfully murky. The weather in February was dire, you may recall. All that fog...'
'Fred...'
'All right, I'm coming. Nice to see you again, Sandy.'
'But I tell you, you can't go yet!' Macpherson's voice rose to a wail. 'I've got the perfect ending to my film --- and you're an essential part of it. You and the dog,' he added. 'Please. You can't let me down now.'
Rowlands leant down to speak to the superintendent through the open window of the police car. 'It looks as if I won't be coming to London with you, after all,' he said, with an apologetic shrug. And although he regretted missing this chance to see the Major, he knew there would be other opportunities. Staying at Mildenhall for a bit longer meant he might get to see his daughter once more. Now that the nightmare of the past few months was over, Anne had returned to her duties with renewed enthusiasm --- making up for all the leave she'd been granted by taking on extra tasks, and offering to relieve some of the others in her unit when they, too, needed time off. 'Because it's only fair, Daddy,' she'd said, the last time they'd met. 'The other girls rallied round when I was at home for all that time, so it's only right that I should cover for them.'
Rowlands agreed with this admirable principle, but recalled that not all Anne's fellow WAAFs had 'rallied round' quite so considerately. 'How's Miss Taylor?' he couldn't resist asking. 'Oh, Joyce is getting engaged --- to Bingo Callander. There's to be a big "do" in London. I'm invited,' she said casually. Which suggested that the animosity towards his daughter he'd observed on the part of the other girl had, to some extent, diminished now that she --- Miss Taylor --- had achieved her ambition of 'bagging' a member of the coveted Moncrieff set. As he allowed Macpherson --- still babbling excitedly about his film --- to lead him in the direction of the hangars, he wondered if he might send a message asking Anne to meet him in the canteen for lunch. It was getting on for that time, and with nothing more than a cup of tea to refresh himself during the meeting in Forrester's office, he was starting to feel a bit peckish. He thought regretfully of the pie and pint he'd just forgone. 
'I thought about here would give us the best shot,' Macpherson was saying. 'So that we can get the Lancs in the background, do you see? I want you and the dog facing towards the dispersals --- watching one of the planes taking off, and then saluting as it leaves the ground...'
'"Saluting"?' interrupted Rowlands. 'You don't mean to say that I'll have to put on that uniform again?'
'It'll give a nice feel to the thing,' Sandy Macpherson replied. 'The old guard... sorry, that's you... paying homage to the younger generation of fliers...'
'Hey, you!' came a shout from across the field, breaking into this sentimental fantasy. 'What the bloody hell are you doing, eyeing up my plane? This is a military zone... Oh, it's you,' added the speaker, on recognising the film director. 'Thought we'd done with your lot.'
'You have --- almost,' was the cheerful reply. 'Just putting the finishing touches. If it's all the same to you, I'd like to do a closing shot of C-Charlie taking off, with Mr Rowlands here in the foreground, and...'
'Rowlands?' interrupted the plane's captain. 'You're the man who found me half-dead, and got the MO to me in time. If it hadn't been for you, I might not have made it.'
'Anyone would have done the same,' said Rowlands. 'Glad to see you're fighting fit again, Flight Lieutenant Raikes.'
'No thanks to that snake-in-the-grass Hawkins if I wasn't,' said Reggie Raikes. 'Never saw it coming. One minute it was, "Mind if I come on board, Flight Lieutenant? Got a couple of things I need to discuss with you..."; the next, it was a gun-butt to the back of my head, and lights out...'
'Bad show,' said Macpherson. 'I hope the blighter gets what's coming to him.' 
'No doubt of that,' replied Raikes. 'Well, it was good to meet at last, Mr Rowlands. I've been wanting to shake the hand of the man who saved my life, ever since I came round in the sick bay, with seven stitches in my head, and no memory of how I'd got there.' 
Rowlands accordingly held out his hand and felt it warmly grasped. Then Macpherson, obviously chafing at the bit, said that if they were going to do the shoot that day, they'd better get on. 'Sounds as if you've been having a rather exciting time of it since we last met,' he remarked, as he and Rowlands, with Rex padding along beside, made their way back towards the hangar which had been allocated for the use of the film crew, and where their equipment was being stored. Rowlands agreed that this was so. 'A pity, really, that we can't use any of it in our film,' added Macpherson slyly --- at which Rowlands merely grunted. It wasn't a story that would ever be told, he thought --- or at least, not while those concerned were still alive. That the one most directly responsible for the mayhem would not trouble the world much longer still left a good many people as guilty as he was, if the truth were told. As the superintendent had said, these --- Lord Haverstock and his cronies in National Resurgence --- would doubtless escape the penalty that Derek Hawkins would pay...
So immersed in these thoughts was Rowlands that he failed to hear the sound of approaching footsteps across the asphalt, until the owner of them was almost upon him. A joyful bark from Rex brought him to his senses in the same moment as Anne --- for that was who it was --- cried, 'Daddy! What are you doing here?' In the weeks since their airfield adventure (if that was the word for it), he'd had very little contact with his middle daughter, apart from the Sunday telephone calls, which had once been their only regular communication in the days before Jan Wawrzkowicz had come into their lives, and which had now been resumed. 
What a lot had happened in the four --- nearly five --- months since he'd first heard the Polish fighter's name! But then things did seem to happen more quickly these days. It was the war, he thought. 'Hello, you,' he said. 'I'm not stopping long, as it happens. Mr Macpherson --- Sandy, I mean --- wants me for a final shot for his film. I hope it won't take too long, because I'd promised your mother I'd be back in time for supper this evening...'
'Oh, it won't take long,' said Macpherson airily. 'Let's get you kitted out in your uniform first... I say,' he added to Anne. 'I don't suppose I could borrow you for an hour or two? Only I'm short-handed --- most of the crew are in Cambridge, setting up for the next film. Short piece about the University OTC: "How Our Brightest And Best Are Getting Ready To Go To War"... I've only Monty and a cameraman to help me.'
'Well, I don't know,' said Anne. 'I've got to take these files across to the Pay Office. I was on my way there when I spotted you. Section Leader Henderson won't be very pleased if I ask for any more time off, after all the leave I've taken.'
But the Hellcat, it seemed, was in a forgiving mood --- or perhaps her fearsome reputation concealed a softer side. Because once Anne had carried out her errand and been to ask permission, she found herself released from duties for the afternoon. 'I think she's got a soft spot for Sandy,' said Anne, now acting as wardrobe mistress and general dogsbody. 'As soon as she heard it was to do with the film she caved in. "Tell your father I'll be looking out for his cameo role when this film finally gets its release," was what she said. She really is a good sport.' 

Even with his limited experience of the film industry, Rowlands should have anticipated that there would be delays. As he stood waiting for Sandy Macpherson to finish giving his instructions to the camera crew, he reflected that there'd been a good deal of hanging around the previous time he'd been inveigled into acting (a small, non-speaking role in a German production) ten years before. Film directors had to be perfectionists, he supposed --- constantly striving for the magical combination of images and words that would convey whatever it was they wanted to convey... whether it was a piece of wartime propaganda, such as this, or the Burning of Atlanta... 'All right!' he heard Macpherson say. 'Places, please, everybody. And... action!'
Rowlands, who had been 'in place' for the past twenty minutes, now did as he had been directed --- that is, to stand absolutely still, with his face turned towards the sound of the Lancaster's engines whirring into life, one by one. They'd already done several 'takes' of this scene that afternoon, with Rowlands himself and the patient Rex standing like sentinels, as the camera moved in for a close-up, or pulled back for a long shot. They hadn't, in the end, been able to use C-Charlie, which was one of those slated to fly a mission that night, and had therefore to be got ready for this. Instead, another plane --- T-Tommy --- was to take its place. The crew of this, with their skipper, Flight Sergeant Doug Baker, had been pulled away from the game of poker with which they had been whiling away the time, and asked to go through the motions of taking off.
'It's just the first few minutes I want --- the Lanc accelerating along the runway, and then leaving the ground, and climbing up into the clouds,' said Macpherson. 'I'll be focusing on you at the same time, Fred, so it's important that you follow all this with your gaze --- or seem to,' he added, perhaps recalling that, for the man he was addressing, the act of gazing could only be simulated.
It was getting on for six o'clock and the light was fading by the time Macpherson was satisfied, by which time the seven members of the aircrew were becoming decidedly mutinous (to judge from the muttered remarks Rowlands caught), while he himself was stiff from standing for so long in the same position. It reminded him of the time he'd sat for his portrait... in fact, now he came to think of it, young Macpherson exhibited just the same ruthless attention to detail Rowlands' artist friend Percy Loveless had brought to composing his picture. He was beginning to think that if the director didn't call 'Cut' soon, he'd have to change position in order to prevent his leg from going to sleep, when that blessed relief came. 'Good work, everybody. Tea time, I think, don't you?'
Although it was nearer dinner time; Rowlands' hopes of getting back to Brighton in time to share that repast with his wife were not to be realised, he saw. And so, after taking his leave of Anne, it was back to the King's Head for him, where the landlord greeted him like an old friend: 'Quite like old times, Mr Rowlands, sir,' he said. 'I was saying to the wife only the other day, "Isn't it funny that our Tommy's room --- that's the room you've got, sir --- has scarcely been empty since he went away?"' Rowlands learned that a letter from the couple's missing son had recently been received, through the Red Cross. 'He says he's well, sir --- but that the food where he is isn't up to much.' The landlord conveyed this information as if it were of the greatest significance (which it was to him). 'He's well, though --- that's the main thing.' Rowlands agreed that it certainly was.
He was tired after a day of standing around, doing nothing much --- which was ridiculous, he thought wryly, recalling how much greater the exertions of his soldering days had been, and with far less effect --- so, after a supper of roast chicken, washed down with a pint of the local beer, he took himself off to bed, in what he now knew was Tommy Catchpole's old room. 'Keeping it warm for him, you are, sir,' said the landlord happily. 'Won't be long now afore he's back safe in his own home --- I feel it in my bones.'
It didn't seem as if any time had passed after Rowlands closed his eyes before he was awake again. Something --- a sound --- had woken him, but what? He lay there, his eyes wide open in the dark. There it was again: a light pattering, as of gravel being throw at a windowpane... At once he was out of bed and across the room, disturbing Rex, who let out a low bark at his master's sudden movement. 'It's all right,' Rowlands told him. The casement was already open a crack; he pushed it further open. 'Who's there?' he asked softly.
It somehow wasn't a surprise when the voice that replied to his question had a Polish accent. 'You come with me,' it said. 'There is no time to lose.' Nor did Rowlands waste much time getting dressed, taking case to make as little noise as possible, so as not to wake his sleeping hosts. It was a quarter past eleven by his Braille watch when he and Rex left the pub, and climbed into the jeep in which they had ridden once before, under duress. Their guide, too, seemed to recall this occasion for he laughed, a shade uneasily, as Rowlands settled the dog at his feet. 'I see you have your protector with you,' he said. 'Let us hope he and I can be friends. His teeth are too sharp for my liking.'
'Rex is a calm and well-behaved animal --- except when roused,' replied Rowlands --- with which the dog himself seems to concur, for he neither barked nor growled at the presence of his former adversary.
It was just before midnight when they turned in at the gates of Audley End House and, bumping once more along its pothole-strewn drive, arrived at the stable-yard, where they had parked on that earlier nighttime visit. As they entered by the kitchen door, and began to climb what he guessed were the back-stairs, Rowlands half-expected to be taken up to the attic, where he had met Jan Wawrzkowicz for the first time all those weeks before; but Osmecki led him only as far as the first floor, and along what seemed an endless series of corridors. Stopping at last outside a door, he knocked softly. At once the door flew open. 'Quiet!' hissed a voice. It was Wawrzkowicz. 'Ah, it is you. Come in --- and leave the dog outside.'
'All right. Stay, Rex.'
A moment later, Rowlands found himself in what he judged to be a former sitting-room, or perhaps a bedchamber --- now emptied of most of its furniture, and with its carpets rolled up, exposing the floorboards. Without another word, Wawrzkowicz led him across the room to where several men were gathered around another of their number, who sat at a desk, on which radio equipment was set up. This was at once evident to Rowlands from the unmistakeable sound of Morse Code being transmitted. It took him another moment to work out that this was not being done from within the room, but was being picked up from elsewhere --- somewhere not far away, he guessed. Perhaps within the very building in which they now stood. 
As the implications of this became clear to him, he turned his face to where he knew Wawrzkowicz to be standing, as if to ask whether his suspicion was correct. In spite of the darkness (the only illumination being from a small desk-lamp), the other seemed to understand the unspoken question, for he said in a low voice, 'You wanted to know if we had found our traitor --- and I believe we have.'
'In which case...' Rowlands broke off what he had been going to ask, but Wawrzkowicz was once more ahead of him: 'In which case why have we not arrested him?'
'Yes.'
'We are hunting high and low for him at this very moment, Mr Rowlands. We will find him, never fear --- and very soon.' Indeed, as he spoke, the steady, relentless stream of morse code that had been emanating from the radio ceased abruptly. 'Ah,' said Wawrzkowicz in a satisfied tone. 'I believe we have him. It will not be long now...'
A few minutes passed, in tense silence, before voices were heard in the corridor outside. There came a furious shout, followed by a slap; the sounds of a scuffle. A moment later the door burst open, and two men came in, dragging a third between them. That there were other men crowding into the passageway was evident from the angry muttering of voices, and from the dog's warning bark --- Rex's concern being always for any potential threat to his master. Wawrzkowicz went to the door and gave a command. At once the hubbub subsided. Having closed the door behind him, he turned to the man the others had brought in. 'So,' he said in a voice devoid of expression. 'It was you.'
Of the ensuing conversation between the two men, conducted in rapid Polish, Rowlands understood very little, but the intonation --- accusatory on one side, self-exculpating on the other --- told its own story. It was initially hard to distinguish anything of what was being said by the accused man, because his voice had sounded thick, as if he were speaking through a mouthful of blood. Only when Wawrzkowicz told him to clean himself up, offering a handkerchief for this purpose, did Rowlands realise that this was a voice he had heard before. It was that of the man he'd spoken to outside, on the day he'd first come to Station 43. The man whose English had been a cut above that of the other Poles --- Koprowski, the former student of philosophy.
The exchanges between him and his accuser, Wawrzkowicz, were terse --- the latter restraining his anger with difficulty, it seemed. Rowlands caught the word 'Gestapo' being levelled at the prisoner, and Koprowski's indigent rebuttal of the accusation that he had colluded with that organisation. 'NKVD' was another word --- or rather, acronym --- that Rowlands understood all too well. Koprowski's response to this accusation was silence.
'So,' said Wawrzkowicz, speaking in English for Rowlands' benefit, he supposed. 'It appears our spy here has been in the pay of the Russians --- who are our enemies, whatever the British government might think.'
'I was paid nothing!' cried Koporowski. 'You do not understand. They said they would kill my family... My wife and children...' He was weeping, now. 'I had no choice...' Wawrzkowicz made no reply to this, but addressed the two men who had bought the prisoner. The command was once more in Polish, but the meaning of it was clear enough to Rowlands: 'Take him away.'
At once, Koprowski began to protest. 'Nie, nie... Zabiją mnie!' Again, the  sense of the words was clear from the anguished tone in which they were said. No, no. They'll kill me... But a few words from Wawrzkowicz silenced him. After this brief exchange, Koprowski seemed to pull himself together, for when he spoke again --- in English, this time --- it was with a calm, matter-of-factness that seemed to Rowlands more chilling than his emotional outburst had been. 'Goodbye, Mr Rowlands. We will not meet again, I think. But I would not want you to think me a coward. Whatever I have done, I am still a Polish officer.'
'Captain Koprowski...' But whatever Rowlands might have said by way of consolation to the man who had betrayed his comrades was cut short, by      
Wawrzkowicz's opening the door. At once the men outside surged forward, but a sharp command from the officer checked them and they fell back, to allow Koprowski and his two guards to pass unmolested. As the footsteps of the three men died away along the corridor, Rowlands took the opportunity to give Rex a reassuring pat. The ugly mood of the past few minutes had subsided, but he still felt the horror of what he had just witnessed. 'What will happen to him?' he said to Wawrzkowicz; then, when the other did not immediately reply: 'Shouldn't he at least have a court martial?'
'We do things differently here,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'Oh, do not worry, Mr Rowlands, I do not mean that we will murder him --- although his treachery has brought death to many of the Cichociemni, as well as others --- some of them British agents. But we Poles are not that uncivilised, you know! He will merely be given the means to make amends for what he has done. First, by sending a final message to his controllers in the Russian secret service --- a message, needless to say, which will throw them off the scent for a little while. Then...' He paused to light a cigarette. 'Would you like one?'
'No, thanks. You were saying?'
'He will be given a gun,' said Wawrzkowicz, as if explaining something to a child. 'Of course he will not be permitted to turn it on anyone but himself. That is the honourable way out, do you not agree? Honour is important to our people --- and to yours, I think.'


### Chapter Twenty ###

Rowlands was still musing on the prospect of that lonely death --- would it take place in the house itself, or in the woods outside? --- as he exited the building, accompanied by Wawrzkowicz and the two men, Osmecki and Czarnecki, who had been in the room during Koprowski's interrogation. He wondered what, if anything, they thought about the 'sentence' passed upon their former comrade, and whether it troubled their consciences, or whether the fact of Koprowski's betrayal cancelled out all feelings of compassion towards the doomed man. Doubtless, as Wawrzkowicz had said, the affair would be seen as a matter of honour --- to be resolved only with the death of the traitor.
It struck him that the Mildenhall affair had thrown up not one, but two traitors --- the activities of the one conflated with those of the other, and providing, inadvertently, a smokescreen. But while Hawkins' treachery seemed the more reprehensible, given that it was undertaken in the full knowledge of  what its likely consequences would be --- the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people --- Koprowski's actions could be seen in a very different light. His betrayal had been done under coercion; his choice, baldly put, was between sacrificing his comrades or his children. Rowlands knew that, had he been forced to make the same choice, he wouldn't have hesitated to put his comrades second.
He was jolted from these sombre thought by Wawrzkowicz's voice in his ear: 'I thought,' said the latter, 'that since you have come this far...'  --- he meant something other than just the journey Rowlands had made to get there --- 'you might like to see the end of it.' Rowlands said that he would. 'Then welcome to the Tempsford Taxi,' cried the Pole, in a more playful tone. And indeed, instead of the jeep which had brought him to Station 43, there stood an army lorry, its engines throbbing. 'Get in,' the other urged him. 'You and I will sit in front with the driver.'
Osmecki and Czarnecki, with five other men whom Wawrzkowicz did not introduce, got into the back of the lorry, and they set off at once, the vehicle bumping over the ruts and potholes at such a speed that Rowlands felt there was a good chance he might be bounced out of his seat. But they reached the main road without mishap, picking up speed along they went, but mercifully encountering no other traffic. Rowlands recalled with a shudder that ill-fated late-night drive in the Jaguar a few weeks before, that had ended so ignominiously, and held on as tightly as he could to the edge of his seat.
Almost an hour passed, by Rowlands' braille watch, before the lorry began to slow down, and eventually came to a stop --- indicating that they had arrived at their destination. 'Tempsford airfield,' announced Wawrzkowicz. 'A place that does not exist --- like the place we have just left.' With that, he swung himself down from the lorry's cab, leaving Rowlands to follow suit. As the latter did so, indicating to Rex that he, too, should jump down, he heard the murmur of Polish voices in earnest discussion, as the other passengers clambered out of the back of the vehicle. It was two a.m. 'Come,' said Wawrzkowicz. 'We do not have much time, if we are to take advantage of the moonlight.'
With a touch on the shoulder, he guided Rowlands along a roughly made cinder path towards what the latter guessed were the hangars. Osmecki and Czarnecki and their five comrades trooped behind. From time to time a few words were exchanged between one or other of these men, but the sense of these was unintelligible to Rowlands. He felt as if he were caught up in some protracted dream, which had begun when he'd heard the stones pattering against his bedroom window, and from which he had not yet awoken. Only the solid presence of the dog, padding along beside him, told him that this was no dream. Yet it seemed all part of the general unreality --- the lateness of the hour, and the men muttering in a foreign language, and the sense of mystery surrounding it all --- when there came the sound of a light footstep on the path ahead and he heard his daughter say, 'Hello, Daddy. I wondered if you'd come.'
'Anne. What on earth...?'
'Shh.' He felt her take his arm. 'I insisted. It might be my last chance... I mean to see Jan before 138 Squadron's transferred... I've no idea where, of course.'
'Do not worry, dearest,' said Wawrzkowicz, overhearing this. 'I will be back before you know it.'
They had by now reached the dispersals, where the Wellington awaited its crew of five, and the two men it was to drop over occupied territory --- whether Poland or elsewhere in Europe was not said. Realising that Anne and her fiancé would have things to say to one another, Rowlands moved a short distance away, to give them privacy. A few moments passed. Then things began to move with the inexorable swiftness of all such operations. The crew got on board, with their skipper, Wawrzkowicz, the last to do so. The engines started up, and the plane began to taxi along the runway. 'I just hope it doesn't get stuck in the mud,' said Anne to her father. 'Tempsford's built on a swamp, Jan says. It's the foggiest and boggiest airfield in Bomber Command.' 
Rowlands was not deceived by her bright tone. As the plane took off, with a roar of engines, he squeezed her hand. 'You heard what he said. He'll be back.'
'Yes.' But she didn't sound as if she believed it.

The plane took off, climbing steadily into the sky, until it was lost in a bank of cloud. The man in the uniform of an RAF Wing Commander stood watching it until it was out of sight. Beside him, the dog, a black Labrador, sat as motionless as a figure carved upon a tomb. Words in white italic script appeared across the sky. The End, they read. 
The credits began to roll, and 'God Save the King' began to play, bringing the audience to its feet. 'Well,' said Edith, when this had come to an end and it was time to retrieve coats and umbrellas (for it had been raining when they arrived at the cinema), 'I thought you were very good, Fred. If I hadn't known it was you, I'd never have guessed you weren't who you were supposed to be.'
'It wasn't all about me,' he said, although he was pleased that she'd thought him convincing in the part. 'There must have been at least fifty others onscreen.'
'I know that. And they all did very well. But it was you I was looking out for --- and Anne, of course. Although I only caught a glimpse of her in the background of one scene... '
'Oh, Rex's was the starring role,' said fifteen year-old Joan, who been allowed to accompany her parents to the inaugural showing of the film in London's Leicester Square. 'He's a natural. Look out, Rin Tin Tin!'
'I thought Daddy was very natural, too,' said Margaret, the Rowlandses' eldest daughter, who was spending a few days' leave at home. It was she who'd proposed this visit to London, to see 'Wings Over Germany' in the Pathé News cinema. 'Don't you think so, Frank?' This was to her fiancé, Lieutenant Frank Dawson, who'd managed to wangle his leave from his ship at the same time as Margaret's. 'Rather,' he said loyally. 'Thought the whole thing was jolly good. Although I wish someone'd make a film about the Senior Service, instead of the Brylcreem Boys. They get all the attention...'
'You'll have to ask Mr Macpherson about that,' laughed Rowlands, as the film director, surrounded by some of his admiring acolytes, came towards them. 'We were just saying,' he said to the latter, 'how convincingly your film depicts what really goes on at an airfield.'
'Glad you think so,' said Sandy Macpherson. 'Although as you of all people know, Fred, the film doesn't show the half of it! But I'm glad you enjoyed it. These your daughters?'
'That's right. This is Margaret and this is Joan. And this is my wife, Edith. Not forgetting Margaret's fiancé, Lieutenant Dawson.'
'How d'you do?' said the naval officer. 'I enjoyed the film too. Gripping stuff. Would have been even better if it had been set on a destroyer, instead of at an airfield...'
'Ah, a naval picture's next on the list,' said Macpherson. 'Only trouble is, you chaps are hard to get hold of. Always away at sea.'
'Don't I know it,' murmured Margaret. 'Even getting these three days together took a lot of organising, didn't it, Frank?'
'I'll say.' 
'But there's someone missing,' interrupted Macpherson. 'Where's Anne? I know her part in the film wasn't large --- third WAAF, or whatever it was --- but I'd have thought she'd want to see her moment of glory.'
'Anne couldn't get leave,' said Rowlands, conscious as he gave this excuse that it wasn't the whole story. In the weeks since the couple's last meeting at Tempsford airfield, the night Jan Wawrzkowicz had departed for an unknown destination, Anne had received no word from him. Rowlands guessed --- although nothing had been said --- that she was starting to give up hope. It was no wonder, he thought, that she'd chosen not to attend the screening of the film in which she'd been involved, all those months ago --- months which, though full of anxiety on her lover's behalf, had also been full of happiness. It was the only time they'd had together, she and Wawrzkowicz. If it turned out --- as seemed increasingly likely --- that it would be all the time there was for them, then he couldn't blame her for not wanting to see the film, with all its reminders of what she'd lost.

'Bad news, I'm afraid,' said Iris Barnes, taking a sip of her whisky and soda. They were in the library at her club in St James's --- whose members were all women, although men were admitted as guests. Frederick Rowlands was one such. He took a sip of his own whisky, and waited for what she had to say. It was a warm summer's evening, and a pleasant smell of new-mown grass drifted in through the open windows from the square outside. In spite of the lingering heat of the day, he felt a chill when she spoke at last: 'We heard last night that the plane carrying General Sikorski and his entourage went down off Gibraltar two days ago. It appears there were no survivors, except for the pilot.' She took another sip of her drink. 'I thought you should know... given that it's likely Jan Wawrzkowicz was one of those on board.'
Rowlands made some response --- 'Ah' or 'I see' or something equally meaningless; but really his thought was, 'How am I going to tell Anne?'
As if she had guessed this --- or maybe he had spoken aloud? ---  his companion said, in a sympathetic tone that was unlike her: 'Was she very fond of him?'
'They were engaged.' 
'Ah.' It was her turn to make the inadequate response. 'Then I'm all the more sorry. It'll be hard for her.'
'Harder not to know, I think.' Because in the months that had followed Wawrzkowicz's disappearance, Rowlands had been all too aware of his daughter's silent agony. The terrible words, 'missing in action' had hung like a pall over every encounter. 'She's eating her heart out over that man,' said Edith, her tone mingling concern and exasperation at her daughter's intransigence. Now, at least, he thought, the uncertainty was over. Surely the fact that she knew that Wawrzkowicz was dead, would bring an end to her misery?
'We don't yet know who was responsible,' Miss Barnes was saying. 'But we've a few possible candidates --- the Russians being top of the list.'
Her words added a new element of horror. 'Do you mean it wasn't an accident?'
'Unlikely,' was the reply. 'Given that he --- Sikorski --- was Prime Minister in exile, commander-in-chief of the Polish Army and therefore an important figure in the Polish resistance, assassination seems all too probable, wouldn't you say?'
'That's appalling,' said Rowlands.
'It's war,' said Iris Barnes. 'The question is, which one --- the one we're fighting at this moment, or the one we've yet to fight?'
'I don't follow.'
'Oh, I think you do, Fred. It's the war that's been going on all the time we've been fighting Hitler. Although the enemy we've been up against is currently calling itself our "friend". Do you see it now?'
He did see. 'And Poland's been in the front line of this other war, as it were...'
'Precisely.' She lit a cigarette. 'Unfortunately, it's already too late for Poland.'
So Jan Wawrzkowicz's death had been in vain, thought Rowlands. Poland would never be free --- not while Stalin and his crew were in charge. He wouldn't say this to Anne, however. If she could hold onto the thought that her lover's death had been for a purpose --- and a noble one at that --- it might prove some consolation... 'Can I tell her --- Anne, I mean --- about what happened to Jan?' he asked, after a moment. The MI5 agent thought about it. 'They were engaged, you say?'
'Yes.' He didn't add that it had been an unofficial engagement.
'Then I don't see why not. But tell her not to spread the news around.'
'She won't do that.' In the brief silence that followed, Rowlands could hear the gleeful shouts of children, playing with a dog in the square. His own animal lay placidly at his feet, awaiting the signal from his master that it was time to move. 'I sometimes think,' said Iris Barnes, 'that it's better not to get too involved --- emotionally, I mean --- when there's a war on. It leaves too many casualties.'
He said nothing to this, but finished his drink. 'I'd better be going,' he said, after a moment. 'Edith will be expecting me.'
She wasn't quite finished, however. 'That was a neat piece of work on your part,' she said, as he got to his feet, the dog following suit in the same moment. 'Getting Hawkins in the bag, so to speak. We'd be after him for a while. But it took you --- and your daughter --- to flush him out.'
'Glad to be of service,' said Rowlands, with a shrug; but he felt anything but glad. It was a dirty business, the secret war --- and, as she had said, it left too many casualties.
