⚠️ Deprecation Notice: submit_batches.sh

The legacy wrapper script submit_batches.sh has been deprecated.
It remains in the repository only as a compatibility shim:
	•	When invoked, it prints a warning.
	•	It then forwards all arguments to submit_ranges.sh.
	•	Exit codes and behaviour are identical to submit_ranges.sh.

Recommended replacement:

./submit_ranges.sh --draft FILE --mode MODE --models m1[,m2] --ranges "A B;C D"

Removal timeline: the shim will be removed in a future release. Please update any scripts or automation to call submit_ranges.sh directly.
